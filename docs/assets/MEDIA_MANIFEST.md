# Docs media capture manifest

**Status: 6 of 14 slots are real photographic captures; the remaining 8 are hand-illustrated,
app-faithful SVGs.** Both live in `docs-site/public/assets/screenshots/` and
`docs-site/public/assets/gifs/` and are wired into their pages' `<Figure src="...">` prop; the
`Figure` component's dashed-placeholder fallback (see `docs-site/src/components/Figure.astro`)
is not in use anywhere in the built site.

Captured for real (v0.8.1, dark mode, native window, no Dock/menu bar in frame):
`first-workspace-empty-state.png`, `the-orifold-window-annotated.png`,
`annotate-markup-tools.png`, `night-mode-comparison.png`, `reader-mode-toggle.png`,
`language-switcher.png`.

Still illustrated SVGs (open work — replace per the standards below when captured):
`import-files-overview.svg`, `combine-reorder-pages.svg`, `reorder-rotate-delete-pages.svg`,
`edit-text-workflow.svg`, `sign-document-workflow.svg`, `export-save-confirmation.svg`,
`recently-viewed-shelf.svg`, `companion-gami-ori.svg`. The recently-viewed shelf and the
Gami/Ori side-by-side comparison in particular need either a persisted recent-files list or a
companion-switch reset to capture for real — not just opening the app once.

The top-level `docs/assets/screenshots/` and `docs/assets/gifs/` folders remain unused
(placeholder `.gitkeep` only) — the Astro site serves only from `docs-site/public/assets/`.

## Capture standards (apply to every asset)

- **App UI only.** No personal files, desktop clutter, browser tabs, terminal output, emails,
  usernames, or real file paths anywhere in frame.
- **Demo content only.** Use a small set of clean, obviously-fake sample PDFs/images (e.g.
  `Sample Agreement.pdf`, `Sample Invoice.pdf`, `Sample Scan.pdf`) — never a real document.
- **Consistent chrome.** Dark mode (the app default), same window size (1600×1000 recommended),
  same zoom level, same companion (pick one of Gami/Ori and stick with it across all captures).
- **Format.** PNG for static screenshots, GIF (or MP4 transcoded to GIF) for motion — keep GIFs
  under ~3–4 seconds looped and under ~2 MB; downscale/optimize before committing.
- **Naming.** `kebab-case-workflow-name.png` / `.gif`, matching the filenames below exactly.

Each target page's placeholder `alt` text repeats the exact filename and framing above, so
whoever captures these can grep the docs source for a filename and know precisely what to shoot.

## After capturing a real asset

1. Drop the file into `docs/assets/screenshots/` or `docs/assets/gifs/`.
2. Copy it into `docs-site/public/assets/screenshots/` (or `/gifs/`) so Astro can serve it — the
   Astro site does not read from the top-level `docs/` folder directly.
3. Update that page's `<Figure src="/Orifold/assets/screenshots/<file>" alt="..." caption="..." />`,
   replacing the placeholder (no `src`) with the real path.
4. Remove the corresponding row from this table once the page no longer has a placeholder.
