## A Cleaner Save, Export, and Editing Release

pdFold v5 tightens the everyday workflow around saving, exporting, and small editing details. Normal macOS Save/Save As now stays PDF-first, while the export menu keeps the broader formats users expect when they need DOCX, Markdown, text, HTML, image pages, or print output.

The release also preserves original source data for supported non-PDF imports, adds safer same-format export behavior, covers the source round trip with focused tests, and includes a more organized toolbar plus an optional in-app helper.

## Install

```zsh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/udhawan97/pdFold/main/install.sh | zsh
```

Direct download: [`pdFold.zip`](https://github.com/udhawan97/pdFold/releases/latest/download/pdFold.zip)

The installer downloads the latest `pdFold.zip`, installs `pdFold.app` to `~/Applications`, creates Desktop commands for launch/update and uninstall, clears quarantine metadata, and opens pdFold.

Homebrew users can install the same prebuilt release app through the repository cask:

```zsh
brew tap udhawan97/pdfold https://github.com/udhawan97/pdFold
brew install --cask udhawan97/pdfold/pdfold
```

## What's New in v5

### PDF-First Save Path

- Standard macOS Save and Save As write flat PDF output by default.
- The previous `.pdfoldproj` workspace save type has been removed from app metadata and installer checks.
- Existing export/share choices remain available for users who need another output format.

### Source-Aware Export

- Unchanged same-format exports can return original bytes for supported source documents.
- Source payload metadata is embedded into saved PDFs so reopened documents can recover safe export context.
- `.doc`, `.odt`, and `.rtf` join the export menu.
- Text-like formats can map unique inline edits back into the source export.
- Ambiguous, unmapped, PDF-only, or lossy package-format edits fail clearly instead of quietly producing misleading files.

### Inline Text Editing Polish

- Choosing the same font size no longer counts as a style change.
- Real edits preserve at least the original detected text bounds, reducing collapsed geometry after style-only interactions.
- Regression tests cover no-op Done behavior, same-size style changes, and live inline edits across supported source samples.

### Toolbar and Optional Helper Polish

- Search, contents, signature, edit, annotation, export, guide, and inspector controls are grouped more deliberately in the toolbar.
- Foldy, the optional pdFold helper, reacts to common actions and can be hidden from the app menu or popover.
- Helper bubbles avoid blocking normal canvas input.

### Installation Choices

- The original one-line installer remains available and still creates Desktop launch/update and uninstall commands.
- A tap-compatible Homebrew cask is included for users who prefer `brew install --cask`.
- README install, update, and uninstall sections now document both routes.
