# Orifold — Professional Object Editing System

**Status:** Implemented through the current object-editing beta; this document now records the binding architecture and deferred scope.
**Audience:** Contributors maintaining or extending object editing. This document is the single source of truth for the feature's architectural constraints and deferred scope.
**Scope:** Select, move, resize, rotate, delete, duplicate, align, layer, and restyle visual objects inside PDFs — lines, arrows, rectangles, ellipses, borders, table/grid lines, images, icons, logos, signatures/stamps, drawn shapes, vector paths, annotation objects, form widgets, decorative artifacts, grouped objects, Form XObject instances, and flattened elements (fallback-only).
**Constraint:** Orifold stays **local-first, free, and open-source**. No network, no telemetry, no new paid dependency. All processing runs through the already-bundled PDFKit / PDFium / qpdf.

## 0. How to read this plan (and the one fact that changes everything)

Sections 0–17 preserve the implementation plan and its original audit baseline. Read the dated results in §0.2 and the current module map in §0.3 before treating an original gap or future-tense statement as current behavior.

This plan was assembled from a full architecture audit of the current code plus five design workstreams. **Where the workstreams disagreed, this document states one canonical answer.** Do not re-introduce the alternatives. The reconciliations (object identity, the editability enum, the operation struct, cache naming, delete-engine primacy, Form-XObject semantics) are recorded in **Appendix A** — read it before writing any model code, or three incompatible object systems will be built against the same on-disk schema.

**The load-bearing discovery.** The PDFium binary Orifold already links (`Packages/PDFiumBinary`, the espresso3389 chromium xcframework) **exports the complete page-object editing API**, verified by `nm` on the built framework:

- Enumerate: `FPDFPage_CountObjects`, `FPDFPage_GetObject`, `FPDFPageObj_GetType`, `FPDFPageObj_GetBounds`
- Transform: `FPDFPageObj_GetMatrix` / `SetMatrix` / `Transform` / `TransformF`, `FPDFImageObj_SetMatrix`
- Delete (true, structural): `FPDFPage_RemoveObject`, `FPDFPageObj_Destroy`
- Insert / z-order: `FPDFPage_InsertObject`, `FPDFPage_InsertObjectAtIndex`
- Style: `FPDFPageObj_Get/SetStrokeColor`, `Get/SetFillColor`, `Get/SetStrokeWidth`, `Get/SetDashArray`, `GetDashCount`, `GetDashPhase`, `GetLineCap`, `GetLineJoin`
- Vector paths: `FPDFPath_CountSegments`, `GetPathSegment`, `MoveTo` / `LineTo` / `BezierTo` / `Close`, `Get/SetDrawMode`, `FPDFPageObj_CreateNewPath` / `CreateNewRect`
- Images: `FPDFImageObj_GetBitmap` / `SetBitmap` / `GetImagePixelSize` / `LoadJpegFileInline` (declared+used today) + `GetImageDataDecoded` / `GetImageMetadata` / `GetImageFilter`
- Form XObjects: `FPDFFormObj_CountObjects`, `GetObject`, `RemoveObject`
- Clip & form fields: `FPDFPageObj_GetClipPath`, `FPDFPage_HasFormFieldAtPoint`, `FPDFPage_FormFieldZOrderAtPoint`
- Commit + save: `FPDFPage_GenerateContent`, `FPDF_SaveAsCopy`

Crucially, `Orifold/Engine/PDFCompressionService.swift` **already ran the full `enumerate → mutate image bitmap → FPDFPage_GenerateContent → FPDF_SaveAsCopy` loop** (`PDFCompressionService.swift:201-256`), binding PDFium symbols with `@_silgen_name` (no C header needed) and using the alias trick (`@_silgen_name("FPDF_LoadPage")`, `:6-7`) to avoid duplicate-symbol link errors. **This was the template used to build the object system.** At plan time, the additional path/transform/style/remove symbols were not yet declared in Swift; they are now centralized in `PDFiumObjectBindings.swift` and used by the shipped structural editing path.

**The make-or-break unknown at plan time** was whether `FPDFPage_GenerateContent` — which re-emits the *entire* page content stream from PDFium's in-memory model — round-tripped real-world pages without perturbing untouched text/vector content, and whether object identity survived that round-trip. Phase 0 proved the structural lane and uncovered the mandatory color-preservation pass; see §0.2 for the recorded result.

## 0.1 Revision 2 delta (2026-07-07, after Editing-Hardening-V2 shipped to main at `ec02859`)

Two editing-hardening passes shipped after this plan was written (`docs/EDITING_HARDENING_V2_PLAN.md`, WP-0…WP-8, plus the ops↔bytes reconciliation work at `a416d9d`). They **strengthen** this plan — nothing in the architecture changes — but eight deltas are binding on the implementer:

1. **`PageGraphicsIndex` now exists and is a shipped subset of §2's detection engine** (`Orifold/Engine/PageGraphicsIndex.swift`, built once per page by `PDFTextAnalysisEngine.graphicsIndex(page:)` at `PDFTextAnalysisEngine.swift:208-…`, bounds-only, scan-capped with `didTruncateScan`). It classifies thin PATH objects into horizontal/vertical **rules** (thresholds proven in production: `maxRuleThickness 2.5pt`, `minRuleLength 6pt`, `ruleAspectRatio 4:1` — reuse these in §2.1's line/table classification) and already powers underline detection, table-merge vetoes, column splits, erase-patch hole-punching (`rulesNear`), and Match grid exclusion (`isInsideRuledGrid`). **`PDFObjectDetectionEngine` (§2) must extend this same per-page PDFium pass — do not add a second full object scan per page.** Practically: generalize `graphicsIndex(page:)`'s walk into the full typed enumerator (§2.1) and have `PageGraphicsIndex` become a derived view over the object map (or share the single loop). Also inherit its scan cap + `didTruncateScan` degradation pattern for the `flattenedRaster` ceiling in §3.5.
2. **Rules are now load-bearing for TEXT editing.** A thin line detected as an object may simultaneously be (a) a text underline claimed by underline detection, (b) a table rule protected by erase-patch clipping, or (c) a merge-veto boundary. Deleting/moving such a rule as an *object* is legitimate, but the object system must invalidate `textAnalysisCache` for that page on commit (already required, §3.5) so text analysis re-derives underline/merge decisions from the post-edit bytes. Add a Loop-3 test: delete a rule that served as an underline → the text block reopens without `underline=true`.
3. **Pristine base bytes now persist across reopen** (`OrifoldMetadata.editableOriginalMemberPDFData`, saved only for members with committed ops; restored as `WorkspaceDocument.restoredOriginalMemberPDFData`, `WorkspaceDocument.swift:60, 141, 228`). §3.5's "detection runs against pristine bytes" now holds across reopen too. **Extend the persist-condition to also fire for members with `objectEditStates`** (it currently keys on text ops only), and note the payload doubles down on the base64-blob size concern (§8.2).
4. **Load/export reconciliation exists and MUST become object-aware** (`reconcileCommittedEditsWithLoadedPages()`, `WorkspaceViewModel.swift:2946`): it self-heals ops↔bytes divergence by regenerating `f(pristine, textOps)` from the pristine base. **If a page also carries object ops, that regenerate must apply BOTH op sets** — otherwise the first text-edit self-heal on an object-edited page silently reverts every object edit. This is a hard integration requirement for Phase 3; add a test: page with one text op + one object move → force divergence → reconcile → both survive.
5. **Structural page ops now clone/cascade text ops — object ops need identical treatment**: `duplicatePages` clones ops into the duplicate (`WorkspaceViewModel.swift:6305`), page-delete cascades remove them (`:1229, :6188, :6225`), and cross-member `movePage` rebases pristine bases. Mirror all three for `objectEditStates` (the §3.5/§8 cascade list gains `duplicatePages` cloning and `movePage` rebasing, not just deletion).
6. **Sanitize-for-sharing now strips the `/OrifoldWorkspaceComments` blob** (WP-8, `WorkspaceDocument.swift:44, 710`; `WorkspaceViewModel.swift:4508`). Consequence for §9/§10: a sanitized export **loses `objectEditStates` and the pristine base — by design**. This is *safe* for object edits precisely because Lane-A edits are structural (the baked bytes already carry them); only re-editability is lost. Assert in the §11 matrix: sanitize an object-edited export → edits still visible, object metadata absent (mirror `SanitizedExportLeakTests`).
7. **Test infrastructure to reuse**: `Tests/OrifoldTests/Support/EditingFixturePDFBuilder.swift` already builds deterministic fixtures whose rules/underlines are **genuine PATH page objects** (CGContext strokes PDFium reports as type-2 paths). §11's `ObjectFixtureFactory` should extend it (add image-XObject + known-typed-path builders via the PDFium creation API) rather than starting fresh. Redo is now **⌘Y** (not ⇧⌘Z) everywhere.
8. **Line-ref drift**: code refs in this document were captured at `5f85f9a`; V2 added ~380 lines to `WorkspaceViewModel` and ~360 to `ReadingCanvas`. Key anchors as of `ec02859`: `applyInlineTextEdit` `:2726`, `regenerateEditedPage` `:2866`, `InlineTextEditSnapshot` `:1299`, `OrderSnapshot` `:1281`, `registerIsolatedUndo` `:1395`, `reconcileCommittedEditsWithLoadedPages` `:2946`, `PageObjectSelectionTarget` `ReadingCanvas.swift:1648`, `SignatureSelectionOverlayView` `:1678`, `gestureRecognizerShouldBegin` `:691`. **Treat all `file:line` refs as anchors-by-symbol-name: grep for the symbol, don't trust the number.**

## 0.2 Phase 0 results — GATE PASSED, with one mandatory new requirement (2026-07-09)

The Phase-0 spike is **built, run, and GREEN** as a permanent test: `Tests/OrifoldTests/Phase0PDFiumRoundTripSpikeTests.swift` (two tests, ~0.07s, run under `pdfiumLock`). It declares the exact production PDFium symbols via `@_silgen_name` (the alias trick, test-local `p0_*` names) and proves on **real bytes** the full chain `enumerate → SetMatrix/RemoveObject → GenerateContent → SaveAsCopy → reopen`:

- **R0** — object count stable across `GenerateContent` (5→5 on translate). ✔
- **R1** — structural delete decrements the count (5→4), the object is absent from the re-enumerated graph, **and the region renders as background** (no ghost, verified with PDFium's own rasterizer). ✔
- **R2** — the untouched **text layer survives** the whole-stream rebuild (`attributedString`, per the CI quirk). ✔
- **R4** — translation-invariant `structuralDigest` (matrix a/b/c/d + bounds size) **re-matches** after the round-trip; a moved image still binds to its op. ✔
- **R4b** — **`FPDFPageObj_AddMark` SURVIVES** `GenerateContent`+`SaveAsCopy`+reload → the §3.6/§8.5 marked-content identity **fast-path is available** (not just the digest fallback). ✔

**⚠️ MANDATORY NEW REQUIREMENT — color preservation (the load-bearing finding).** `FPDFPage_GenerateContent` **drops the fill/stroke color of PARSED path objects** — they re-emit as **black**. This corrupts any page with colored fills or a filled background, **including Orifold's own CGContext/Quartz-generated pages** (a common case, since `PDFEditedPageRenderer` produces them). It is **not** a transparency-group artifact (byte-scan confirms no `/Transparency`) and it is independent of whether any object was removed. **Proven mitigation (mandatory in `PDFObjectEditEngine`):** immediately before `GenerateContent`, iterate every `FPDF_PAGEOBJ_PATH` on the page and "touch" its color — `FPDFPageObj_GetFillColor`→`SetFillColor` and `GetStrokeColor`→`SetStrokeColor` with the same values — forcing PDFium to re-emit the color operators. With the touch, the blue rect stays blue and the background stays white; without it, both go black. The spike's `editAndSave(preserveColors:)` is the exact recipe; `testColorTouchIsNecessary` is the regression guard.

**Binding consequences for the rest of the plan:**
- **§8.3 step 4 (`regenerateObjectEditedPage`)** and **§9 Lane A** MUST run the path-color touch pass across the whole page before `FPDFPage_GenerateContent`, on every structural write-back (transform/delete/style/reorder/duplicate). Treat it as a non-optional stage of the PDFium chain, exactly like holding `pdfiumLock`.
- **§8.5 identity:** AddMark is confirmed durable → implement it as the primary fast-path (not "gated/maybe"), with `structuralDigest` as the proven fallback.
- **§8.3/§9 validation gate:** the "per-page text unchanged" canary is **necessary but not sufficient** — add a **fill-appearance canary** (sample a few untouched filled-path centers; assert non-black-collapse) so a regression of the color-touch is caught before bytes are accepted. The spike's PDFium-rasterizer `sampleColor` is the reusable technique.
- **Rasterization caveat:** in a headless test process **PDFKit renders `SaveAsCopy` output unreliably** (all-black); use **PDFium's own `FPDF_RenderPageBitmap`** for any pixel assertion on produced bytes (BGRx buffer, top-left origin). Text *extraction* via PDFKit `attributedString` is fine.
- **GATE VERDICT: GO.** The "PDFium structural rewrite is Lane-A primary" architecture stands; no narrowing to annotations+images is required. Proceed to Phase 1.

## 0.3 Architecture deepening update (2026-07-16)

Three previously binding integration requirements are now concrete modules:

- **One page-object pass:** `PDFPageObjectInspection` owns the bounded PDFium enumeration and derives render-mode regions, `PageGraphicsIndex`, and `PageObjectMap`. `PDFTextAnalysisEngine` and `PDFObjectDetectionEngine` delegate to it.
- **One edit replay path:** `WorkspaceEditReplayEngine` materializes object operations and text operations from the same canonical member bytes, preserves live rotations/annotations across every page, adds a combined bake stamp, and serializes once. `reconcileCommittedEditsWithLoadedPages()` is member-atomic and replays both lanes after divergence. Pristine bytes persist for members edited through either lane.
- **One canvas ordering contract:** `CanvasInteractionSession` plans Delete/Escape/tool/document/geometry sequences; the AppKit coordinator interprets those actions so undo alignment, mutations, document swaps, selection cleanup, and overlay refreshes keep a tested order.

Permanent regression coverage includes both mixed-edit directions, forced divergence/self-healing, later object re-binding, untouched-sibling annotation preservation, all shared inspection projections, and canvas action ordering.

## 1. Original Architecture Audit (historical baseline)

Ground truth from the pre-implementation code review. Every claim carries its original `file:line`; current architecture changes are summarized in §0.3.

### 1.1 Page rendering & the canvas
- **There is no custom bitmap canvas.** The page is displayed by Apple **PDFKit** `PDFView` (subclass `OrifoldPDFView`, `ReadingCanvas.swift:1190`) wrapped in `PDFViewRepresentable: NSViewRepresentable` (`ReadingCanvas.swift:349`), `displayMode = .singlePageContinuous`, `autoScales = true` (`:354-476`). PDFKit internally rasterizes each `PDFPage` at the current `scaleFactor`; Orifold never produces a `CGImage` for on-canvas display.
- **Zoom/scale** is `pdfView.scaleFactor`; overlays read `max(pdfView.scaleFactor, 0.01)` (`:3685`). All view↔page mapping uses `pdfView.convert(_:from/to: page)` (`:1600, :1784, :1811, :3080`). **This returns points in the page's native, *unrotated* space** — `/Rotate` is baked into display only.
- **High-DPI/Retina** is handled entirely inside PDFKit; there is no tiled/LOD rendering and no scale-keyed cache in Orifold code.

### 1.2 How an edit becomes a live page + cache invalidation
- A committed text edit is baked into a **fresh `PDFPage`** by `PDFEditedPageRenderer.regeneratedPage(from:applying:)` (`PDFEditedPageRenderer.swift:14-69`): it redraws the pristine page background (`drawPageBackground`, `:71-96`, via `context.drawPDFPage`), paints erase patches (`drawErasePatch`, `:147-155`), and draws replacement text — all into a `CGContext` PDF, then re-decodes to a `PDFPage`.
- `regenerateEditedPage(pageRef:operations:)` (`WorkspaceViewModel.swift:2681-2709`) swaps that page into the member `PDFDocument`, **re-serializes the member and reloads a fresh `PDFDocument`** so PDFKit drops stale render caches (`:2698-2707`), then `rebuild()` (`:1075-1088`) re-concatenates `combinedPDF` and `syncDocumentPreservingViewport` (`ReadingCanvas.swift:847-880`) repaints without a viewport jump.
- **Cache invalidation is by object-identity:** every commit produces new `PDFDocument`s, discarding PDFKit's cache wholesale; `textAnalysisCache.removeValue(forKey:)` is called for the edited page (`:2696`), and undo/redo `removeAll()`s it (`:1351`). There is **no cheap "redraw one object" path** — every commit is a full member re-serialize + full `combinedPDF` rebuild, too heavy to run per drag-frame.

### 1.3 Content-stream / object access (the enabling layer)
- **`PDFTextAnalysisEngine.swift`** holds the only existing PDFium object-enumeration loop: `renderModeRegions` (`:170-191`) does `FPDFPage_CountObjects → GetObject → GetType==TEXT → GetBounds → GetTextRenderMode`, under the process-wide `pdfiumLock` (`PDFiumProcessingEngine.swift:4`). It always analyzes **pristine `originalMemberPDFData`** (`WorkspaceViewModel.swift:6226`), and matrix marshalling (`FSMatrix`, `:63-70`) is established.
- **`PDFCompressionService.swift`** is the proven mutate+save precedent (`:201-256`): object loop, image bitmap swap, `FPDFPage_GenerateContent` (`:56-57`), `FPDF_SaveAsCopy` (`:77-87`), plus the alias-`@_silgen_name` duplicate-symbol workaround (`:6-7`).
- **`QPDFService.swift`** reaches the PDF object graph losslessly without rasterizing (`sanitized`, `:98-117`; `withQPDF` open/recover/cleanup, `:136-165`; `write`, `:174-182`). The linked qpdf C API *also* exports `qpdf_oh_get_page_content_data` / `get_stream_data` / `replace_stream_data` (`qpdf-c.h:917, 930, 946`) — content-stream editing is reachable but **not yet wired**.
- **`PDFiumProcessingEngine.swift`** owns the shared lifecycle symbols (`pdfiumLock`, `FPDF_InitLibrary/LoadMemDocument/LoadPage/…`).
- **Gap:** no general object model, no path/transform/style silgen declarations, no object classification, no structural write-back wired, no durable per-object identity.

### 1.4 Annotations / widgets / signatures / stamps (the reusable UX spine)
- **A working 8-handle move/resize/delete overlay already exists:** `SignatureSelectionOverlayView` (`ReadingCanvas.swift:1654-1903`) draws outline + 8 handles + delete button, hit-tests, and converts drag deltas to page space via `pdfView.convert(_:to: page)` (`:1784`). It is driven by `PageObjectSelectionTarget` (`:1624-1652`), which already abstracts a selection over *both* a `PDFAnnotation` and a stamp `PageDecoration`.
- Move/resize commits are already undoable document ops with inverse-snapshot undo: `updateStampDecoration` (`WorkspaceViewModel.swift:3447-3478`), `updateSignaturePlacement` (`:3480-3513`), bounds clamped by `constrainedSignatureBounds` (`:3515-3533`).
- Export baking precedents: `PDFDecorationExportBaker.bake` (`:32-83`), `SignatureExportBakingSupport.bake` (`SignatureAppearanceRenderer.swift:309-355`) which returns CGContext bytes **directly** (no `PDFSerializer` round-trip), and a real **vector-path→PDF-content emitter** `CGPath.pdfFillCommands` / `pdfAppearanceStream` (`:254, :114`).
- Form widgets: `PDFFormSupport.scan` + `isPDFWidget` (`:43-67, :220`), highlighted live by `drawFormHighlights` (`ReadingCanvas.swift:1515`).
- **Landmine:** every existing baker redraws the whole page via `page.draw(with:.mediaBox,…)` into a fresh CGPDF context — the documented "PDFKit re-serialization destroys the text layer" path. `AnnotationIndexEntry.swift` is **dead code** (zero references); do not plan around it.

### 1.5 Selection state, edit-op model, undo/redo, persistence
- **Edit ops are per-page structs:** `PDFTextEditOperation` (`PDFTextEditingModels.swift:139-284`, hand-written `init(from:)` with `decodeIfPresent` for schema evolution) held in `PageEditState { pageRefID, operations: [] }` (`:286-290`), stored in `Workspace.pageEditStates` (`Workspace.swift:140`, `schemaVersion = 5` at `:141`).
- **Editability is already an enum precedent:** `PDFTextEditability` (`:13-34`) — the object system mirrors this exactly. Confidence: `PDFTextEditConfidence {high, medium, low}` (`:4-8`).
- **Commit lifecycle** (`applyInlineTextEdit`, `WorkspaceViewModel.swift:2545-2659`): capture snapshot → build/merge op (upsert by `sourceBlockID`, `:2606-2635`) → `regenerateEditedPage` → `rebuild()` + `markWorkspaceModified()` → `registerIsolatedUndo` (`:1320-1331`, forces a standalone undo group). Rollback on renderer failure restores `editStates` only (**not** `pdfData` — a partial-state bug the object path must fix).
- **Snapshot undo/redo:** `InlineTextEditSnapshot { editStates, pageRotations, pdfData }` (`:1238-1242`); `capture`/`restore` (`:1333-1361`) where restore re-registers its inverse for redo.
- **Stable page identity across reopen:** `PageRef.id` (UUID) is the join key (`PageRef.swift:3-46`); `pageRef(for:in:)` maps a live `PDFPage` back to a `PageRef` skipping `BoundaryPage` banners (`:6203-6218`).
- **Reopen persistence:** the whole `Workspace` (incl. edit states) + member bytes round-trip as invisible metadata — `embedMetadata` (`WorkspaceDocument.swift:594-640`) / `importPDFDocument` restore (`:200-206`). `@Published workspace` wires mutations into autosave.
- **Key instability to inherit and solve:** re-analysis assigns brand-new `EditableTextBlock.id`s every pass (`PDFTextEditingModels.swift:154-161`), so text ops fall back to nearest-bounds matching. The object system needs a durable identity (§3.6, §8.5).

### 1.6 Export / serialization / reopen fidelity
- Single export funnel: `WorkspaceDocument.exportedPDFDataThrowing` (`:254-317`) → `concatenateForExport` (`PDFKitEngine.swift:83-104`) → serialize → signature-bake → form-flatten → decoration-bake → comment-bake → embed-metadata. **Every stage funnels through `PDFSerializer.data` = `PDFDocument.dataRepresentation()`** (`PDFSerializer.swift:10-23`) — the exact call that drops Type3/Skia/vector text.
- **Import protects the text layer via qpdf** (`PDFImportNormalizer.normalizedData`, `:38-73`, gated by a two-parser page-count agreement `isTrustworthy`, `:79-91`) — but there is **no export-side equivalent**. Even leak-free member bytes get re-destroyed at assembly.
- Encryption/permissions on export are qpdf-based and self-verified (`PDFEncryptionService.swift:7-72`) — the only existing reopen-from-bytes fidelity check. `verifyExportedFile` otherwise checks only size > 0 (`:4445-4458`).
- `sourcePayloadsForPDFMetadata` disables the faithful-source fast path when `pageEditStates` is non-empty (`:340`) — object edits must do the same.
- `PDFPage.copy()` **silently blanks** CGContext-built pages (`PDFKitEngine.swift:38-46`); never round-trip rendered pages through it.

### 1.7 Toolbar / contextual controls / i18n / design system
- Toolbar mode-switching is `AnnotationToolPicker` (`ContentView.swift:1632`), a capsule over the `AnnotationTool` enum (`WorkspaceViewModel.swift:74-158`) whose `select(_:)` (`:1935-1966`) opens/closes companion palettes. Adding an `AnnotationTool` case yields localized label/icon/help for free.
- Contextual on-canvas toolbar precedent: `InlineTextEditorOverlay` (`ReadingCanvas.swift:2351`), a floating AppKit `NSView` with format controls + move/resize handles + keyDown shortcuts (`:4169-4205`). Delete-key is wired via `OrifoldPDFView.keyDown` → `onDeleteKey` (`:1227-1237`).
- Reusable toolbar kit: `ToolbarIconButton` + `ActiveStyle` (`:2093`), `ToolbarIconMetrics` (`:2081`), `ToolbarVerticalDivider` (`:2065`), `ToolbarMoreMenu` + `MoreRoute` + `pendingMoreRoute` one-runloop-hop (`:2968-3176, 2932-2946`). **Never** a bare `Divider()` in a toolbar group (`:474-479`).
- **i18n:** `L10n.string(_:locale:)` / `L10n.format(_:_:locale:)` (`L10n.swift:41-77`); keys live in `Orifold/Resources/Localizable.xcstrings`; **`LocalizationCoverageTests` fails CI** if any non-interpolated key lacks es/fr/hi/zh-Hans/ja (`LocalizationCoverageTests.swift:8, 57-78`). Interpolated values must use `%@`/`%lld` catalog entries via `L10n.format`, not Swift `\(…)`. New popovers must re-inject `.environment(\.locale, languageManager.effectiveLocale)` (macOS popovers reset locale). Under `swift test`, xcstrings is not compiled — lookups use a raw-JSON fallback (`:44-52, 83-105`), so a key must physically exist in the JSON.
- **Design tokens** (mandatory, no hardcoded colors/spacing): `Color.ds*` / `NSColor.ds*NS` (`DesignSystem.swift:26-197`), spacing (`:201-208`), radii (`:234-238`), typography (`:250-267`), origami motifs `FoldedCornerRect` / `CreaseRule` / `EnsoRing` (`:283-387`). `ContentView.body` is near the type-checker complexity ceiling — factor new presentation logic into `ViewModifier`s.
- Shortcuts: `ShortcutRegistry.all` (`ShortcutRegistry.swift:47-160`) is **descriptive only** — a shortcut must be added there *and* in a real `.keyboardShortcut`/`keyDown` site (drift hazard). `AppCommands` binds ⌘Z/⌘Y (`AppCommands.swift:142-164`).

---

## 2. Object Detection Strategy

Detection is a **new PDFium page-object enumeration pass** in a new engine, `PDFObjectDetectionEngine`, modeled line-for-line on `PDFTextAnalysisEngine.renderModeRegions` (`:170-191`): hold `pdfiumLock`, `FPDF_InitLibrary → FPDF_LoadMemDocument → FPDF_LoadPage`, then walk `FPDFPage_CountObjects / GetObject / GetType`. It **always runs against pristine `originalMemberPDFData`** (`WorkspaceViewModel.swift:398, 6226`) so re-serialization damage never contaminates the map. **Revision 2 (§0.1.1):** a shipped subset of this pass already exists — `PDFTextAnalysisEngine.graphicsIndex(page:)` builds `PageGraphicsIndex` from the same walk. Generalize that loop into this enumerator (one scan per page, `PageGraphicsIndex` becomes a derived view) and reuse its rule thresholds (2.5pt/6pt/4:1) for line/table classification.

**Symbol reality — be honest.** Only `FPDFPage_CountObjects/GetObject/GetType/GetBounds` (`PDFTextAnalysisEngine.swift:88-104`) and the image chain + `GenerateContent` + `SaveAsCopy` (`PDFCompressionService.swift:30-82`) are declared in Swift today. **Everything else this plan uses is undeclared and must be added from scratch** via `@_silgen_name` (verified linked in the binary): `FPDFPageObj_GetMatrix/SetMatrix/Transform`, all `FPDFPath_*`/`FPDFPathSegment_*`, all style getters/setters, `FPDFPageObj_GetClipPath`, `FPDFImageObj_GetImageMetadata/GetImageFilter/GetImageDataDecoded`, `FPDFFormObj_*`, `FPDFPage_RemoveObject/InsertObjectAtIndex`, `FPDFPageObj_Destroy/AddMark`, and the annotation surface `FPDFPage_GetAnnot*`/`FPDFAnnot_*`. For any name already declared elsewhere, use the alias trick (`PDFCompressionService.swift:6-7`) or the build fails with duplicate-symbol errors.

**Two disjoint detection sources, fused per page:**
1. **PDFium content-stream page objects** (`FPDFPage_GetObject`): text, path, image, shading, Form XObject. All native vector/image/shape detection.
2. **PDFKit annotations + Orifold overlay objects**: `page.annotations` (+ `isPDFWidget`, `PDFFormSupport.swift:220`) for annotation-backed graphics/widgets; `workspace.signatures`/`workspace.decorations` for Orifold overlays.

**No annotation-vs-content dedup is needed:** annotations live in `/Annots`, never returned by `FPDFPage_GetObject`. The *only* dedup pass is overlay-vs-content: suppress a content-stream object whose bounds match (within 1pt, same `pageRefID`) an Orifold `SignaturePlacement`/`PageDecoration` rect (the overlay wins — it carries editability metadata). This guards the single real overlap: an Orifold overlay that was baked on a prior export-and-reopen.

### 2.1 Per-category detection & tiers

PDFium type constants: `TEXT=1, PATH=2, IMAGE=3, SHADING=4, FORM=5`.

| Category | Technique (linked API) | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| **Annotations** (ink/note/signature/stamp) | PDFKit `page.annotations` + `signaturePlacementID` key + `workspace.decorations`. Working selection already exists. | **RELIABLE** |
| **Image XObjects** | `GetType==3`; bounds `GetBounds`; matrix `GetMatrix`; pixels `GetImagePixelSize`/`GetImageMetadata`/`GetImageFilter`. Mutation proven (`PDFCompressionService:201-256`). | **RELIABLE** |
| **Vector paths** | `GetType==2`; segment walk `FPDFPath_CountSegments/GetPathSegment` + `FPDFPathSegment_GetType/GetPoint`, `GetDrawMode`; style via stroke/fill/dash getters. | **RELIABLE** |
| **Lines** | Path = `MOVETO` + one `LINETO`, unclosed, stroke-only. | **RELIABLE** |
| **Rectangles** | Closed 4-`LINETO` axis-aligned loop (or `CreateNewRect` shape), right-angle corners within ε. | **RELIABLE** |
| **Filled shapes** | Draw-mode fill/fill+stroke, `GetFillColor` α>0; sub-classify by segment shape. | RELIABLE (shape) / HEURISTIC (semantic role) |
| **Stroked shapes / ellipses** | Draw-mode stroke, `GetStrokeWidth`>0; ellipse = 4-bezier near-circular loop. | RELIABLE (as stroke) / HEURISTIC (ellipse vs rounded-rect) |
| **Table / grid lines** | Many thin line/rect paths grouped by §2.2. | HEURISTIC (as a group) |
| **Form widgets** | `isPDFWidget` + `PDFFormField` scan; `drawFormHighlights`. | **RELIABLE** |
| **Form XObjects** | `GetType==5`; children via `FPDFFormObj_CountObjects/GetObject`. Instance placement (matrix+bounds) reliable; shared-source editing not. | RELIABLE (instance) / FALLBACK (source) |
| **Decorative artifacts** | Inferred: thin rule (aspect > ~20:1), or large low-saturation fill, outside grids, not over text. `/Artifact` BDC not readable via declared surface. | HEURISTIC |
| **Clipped / masked** | `GetClipPath` reports presence (intent unrecoverable → `clipInfo.hasClip`); image SMask via `GetImageMetadata`. | RELIABLE (clip exists); editability degrades (§4) |
| **Flattened / scanned** | Single image covering >~95% of the crop box, no meaningful text layer (reuse `regionIsBlankBackground`, `PDFEditedPageRenderer.swift:338`). | FALLBACK (`rasterRegionReplace`) |
| **Shading / gradient** | `GetType==4`; type+bounds only, no rich accessors. | UNSUPPORTED (select+inspect) |

### 2.2 Grouping vector ops into one semantic object

A **two-tier pass** runs in Swift over the detected primitives (no extra PDFium calls):
- **Tier A — atomic shape recognition:** classify each single `PATH` object by its own segment list into `line/rect/ellipse/polyline/freeform` before any cross-object grouping. An arrow drawn as one stroked polyline stays one object.
- **Tier B — spatial clustering (tables/grids):** bucket `line`/thin-`rect` primitives into horizontal/vertical runs (within 2° of axis); if ≥2 horizontals and ≥2 verticals form a lattice within a common rect, emit **one** `tableGrid` group (`groupSource == .inferredCluster`) whose `children` lists members. Members stay in the map flagged `isGroupChild = true` (suppressed from the default top-layer hit-test, drillable on a second click at the same point — mirroring the reopen-op re-route at `:2370-2399`).

**Form XObject grouping** is the declarative counterpart: when `FPDFFormObj_CountObjects > 0`, that instance's children group under one object with `groupSource == .formXObject(name:)` — no heuristic. (This groups one instance's children; it does not link separate instances of the same source — see §4/§10.)

### 2.3 Confidence scoring

Every object carries `confidence: PDFTextEditConfidence` (reuse the shipping enum, `PDFTextEditingModels.swift:4-8` — do **not** invent a parallel enum). Deterministic:
- **high** — a typed PDFium op or clean annotation matching a recognized primitive exactly; no heuristic fired.
- **medium** — a heuristic agreed with geometry (ellipse-from-beziers, clean lattice, unambiguous rule).
- **low** — ambiguous grouping, unknown-intent clip/mask, or flattened soup. **`low` objects are never default-selectable** (require an explicit "select artifacts" toggle) so a stray click on scanned paper never grabs the whole page.

Confidence gates default hit-test eligibility (only high/medium participate in ordinary click selection) and feeds editability (§4).

---

## 3. Per-Page Object Map (canonical data model)

> **CANONICAL.** This is the one object-model definition. §5, §8, §9 reference these types; they do not redefine them. All types live in a new file `Orifold/Models/PDFObjectEditingModels.swift`, follow `PDFTextEditingModels.swift` conventions (`Codable`, `Equatable`, `UUID` ids, `CGRect` bounds in **raw/unrotated content-stream space**, `PDFTextTransform` matrices, hand-written `init(from:)` with `decodeIfPresent`).

**Central design rule (defeats the ghost/duplicate export trap):** the object map is a **read-only detection index**, never the source of truth for bytes. Detected native objects already exist in `originalMemberPDFData` — they must **never be re-baked on export** or they double up. Only entries in the **operation list** (`PageObjectEditState`, §8) mutate the document. `duplicate` is the *only* op that adds geometry.

### 3.1 Enums

```swift
enum PDFObjectType: String, Codable {
    case annotation, imageXObject, vectorPath, line, rectangle, ellipse,
         filledShape, strokedShape, tableGrid, formWidget, formXObject,
         shading, decorativeArtifact, flattenedRaster
}

enum PDFObjectSource: String, Codable {
    case pdfiumPageObject, pdfKitAnnotation, orifoldDecoration, orifoldPlacement, inferred
}

enum PDFObjectGroupSource: Codable, Equatable {
    case none
    case inferredCluster            // Tier-B spatial cluster (table/grid)
    case formXObject(name: String)  // PDF-declared /Form XObject instance
}

// Ranking helper on the REUSED text-confidence enum (do not invent a parallel enum).
extension PDFTextEditConfidence { var rank: Int { self == .high ? 2 : (self == .medium ? 1 : 0) } }
```

### 3.2 Style + payload value types

```swift
struct PDFObjectStyle: Codable, Equatable {          // CodableColor reused (PDFTextEditingModels.swift:342)
    var strokeColor: CodableColor? = nil             // FPDFPageObj_GetStrokeColor
    var fillColor: CodableColor? = nil               // FPDFPageObj_GetFillColor
    var opacity: CGFloat = 1.0                        // color alpha / SMask
    var lineWidth: CGFloat = 0                        // FPDFPageObj_GetStrokeWidth
    var dashPattern: [CGFloat] = []                   // FPDFPageObj_GetDashArray + GetDashCount
    var dashPhase: CGFloat = 0
    var lineCap: Int = 0
    var lineJoin: Int = 0
}

enum PDFPathSegmentKind: String, Codable { case moveTo, lineTo, bezierTo, close }
struct PDFPathSegment: Codable, Equatable {
    var kind: PDFPathSegmentKind
    var point: CGPoint
    var control1: CGPoint? = nil
    var control2: CGPoint? = nil
    var isClosed: Bool = false                        // FPDFPathSegment_GetClose
}
struct PDFPathData: Codable, Equatable {              // geometry in the object's OWN pre-matrix space
    var segments: [PDFPathSegment]
    var fillRule: Int                                 // FPDFPath_GetDrawMode
    var isStroked: Bool
    var isFilled: Bool
    /// Flattened polyline (beziers pre-flattened HERE, in detection) for the hit-test's
    /// distance-to-segment pass — so §5 stays allocation-free and O(#segments).
    var flattenedStroke: [CGPoint] = []
}
struct PDFObjectImageMetadata: Codable, Equatable {
    var pixelWidth: Int; var pixelHeight: Int         // FPDFImageObj_GetImagePixelSize
    var bitsPerPixel: Int? = nil; var colorSpace: Int? = nil   // FPDFImageObj_GetImageMetadata
    var filter: String? = nil                         // FPDFImageObj_GetImageFilter
    var hasSoftMask: Bool = false
    var pixelDigest: UInt64 = 0                        // FNV-1a of decoded pixels → structuralDigest
}
struct PDFObjectClipInfo: Codable, Equatable {
    var hasClip: Bool = false                         // FPDFPageObj_GetClipPath != nil
    var clipBounds: CGRect? = nil
    var hasSoftMask: Bool = false
}
```

### 3.3 `DetectedObject`

```swift
struct DetectedObject: Codable, Identifiable, Equatable {
    // identity
    var id: UUID = UUID()                    // fresh per detection pass; dies with the cache
    var stableKey: PDFObjectStableKey        // durable cross-reopen identity (§3.6 / §8.5)
    var markedContentId: Int? = nil          // FPDFPageObj_AddMark hint (Phase-0-gated, §8.5)
    var pageRefID: UUID?                      // PageRef.id join key

    // classification
    var objectType: PDFObjectType
    var sourceType: PDFObjectSource
    var confidence: PDFTextEditConfidence    // REUSED enum + .rank (§2.3)
    var editability: PDFObjectEditability     // §4

    // geometry (raw content-stream space)
    var boundsPdf: CGRect                     // FPDFPageObj_GetBounds — POST-matrix AABB; a hit-test hint,
                                              // NOT the thing move/resize edits.
    var transform: PDFTextTransform           // FPDFPageObj_GetMatrix. MOVE/RESIZE/ROTATE mutate THIS via
                                              // SetMatrix/Transform, never boundsPdf, to avoid double-apply.
    var pageRotation: CGFloat                 // page /Rotate, verbatim (EditableTextBlock split, :118-119)
    var zOrder: Int                           // FPDFPage_GetObject index at detection

    // style + typed payloads
    var style: PDFObjectStyle
    var pathData: PDFPathData? = nil
    var imageMetadata: PDFObjectImageMetadata? = nil
    var clipInfo: PDFObjectClipInfo = .init()

    // grouping
    var groupSource: PDFObjectGroupSource = .none
    var children: [UUID] = []
    var isGroupChild: Bool = false
    var formXObjectName: String? = nil
    var isBackgroundLike: Bool = false        // ≥92% crop-box area / full-bleed / decorative (§5.7)

    // session-only (excluded from CodingKeys and ==)
    var boundsViewport: CGRect? = nil         // pdfView.convert result; recomputed, never persisted
    var detectedAt: Date = Date()

    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case id, stableKey, markedContentId, pageRefID, objectType, sourceType, confidence, editability
        case boundsPdf, transform, pageRotation, zOrder, style, pathData, imageMetadata, clipInfo
        case groupSource, children, isGroupChild, formXObjectName, isBackgroundLike, detectedAt
        // boundsViewport deliberately omitted
    }
}
```

> Reconciliation note: this single struct merges the detection workstream's `DetectedObject` and the hit-test workstream's `DetectedPageObject`. The hit-test-only fields (`flattenedStroke`, `isBackgroundLike`) are folded in above.

### 3.4 `PageObjectMap` (transient per-page index)

```swift
struct PageObjectMap: Equatable {            // NOT Codable — never serialized
    var pageRefID: UUID
    var objects: [DetectedObject]             // ascending zOrder
    var analysisRevision: Int = 0             // debug/telemetry only
}
```

### 3.5 Cache: build, invalidate, reuse

One canonical cache on the view model, parallel to `textAnalysisCache` (`:375`):

```swift
private var objectAnalysisCache: [UUID: PageObjectMap] = [:]   // keyed by PageRef.id
func objectMap(for pageRef: PageRef, page: PDFPage, memberID: UUID, localIndex: Int) -> PageObjectMap
```
(name **`objectAnalysisCache`**; ignore the alternate names `ObjectAnalysisCache`/`objectMapCache` that appeared in draft sections.)

- **Lazy.** Nothing is detected until the object tool is active AND a page is clicked/hovered (or the object inspector opens). Per-page, cached, never whole-document eager (heeds the O(pageCount) main-thread footgun at `ReadingCanvas.swift:3744-3752`). Because detection holds the single `pdfiumLock`, run `objectMap(for:)` **off the main actor** and publish back, or bound it with a page-object-count ceiling → `flattenedRaster` above it.
- **Built off pristine bytes** (`originalMemberPDFData`, `:6226`).
- **Invalidated** by `objectAnalysisCache.removeValue(forKey: pageRefID)` on commit (as `textAnalysisCache` is cleared at `:2696`), `removeAll()` on undo-restore (as `:1351`), and a new `removeObjectMaps(forRemovedPageRefIDs:)` in the page-delete cascade (mirroring `:1705`, called from `:1176-1177, :5867, :5904`). **Revision 2 (§0.1.5):** `objectEditStates` must also join the structural-page-op lifecycle that text ops gained in V2 — `duplicatePages` clones ops into the duplicate's new pageRefID (as `:6305` does for text), and cross-member `movePage` rebases the pristine base for both members. An object commit must also invalidate `textAnalysisCache` for the page (§0.1.2 — rules feed underline/merge decisions).
- **Reused for** hit-test/selection (§5), drag/resize preview (overlay proxy, no rebuild), duplicate (adds geometry), and export/undo (map is read-only reference).

### 3.6 Persistence & cross-reopen re-identification

**The map is NOT persisted — it is rebuilt on open** (like `textAnalysisCache`). What persists is the **operation list** `Workspace.objectEditStates: [PageObjectEditState]` (§8), added exactly as `pageEditStates` was: new `CodingKeys` case (`Workspace.swift:143-145`), a `decodeIfPresent` line (`:164`), and a **single coordinated `schemaVersion` bump** (`:141`). It round-trips via `embedMetadata`/`editableWorkspace` (`WorkspaceDocument.swift:200-206, 270-271`); extend `sourcePayloadsForPDFMetadata` (`:336-376`) to disable its fast path when `objectEditStates` is non-empty (as it does for `pageEditStates` at `:340`).

**Durable identity — `PDFObjectStableKey` (canonical; see Appendix A, decision 1).** `FPDFPage_GetObject` is index-based and every commit re-serializes+reloads the document (`:2698-2701`), renumbering objects. Identity therefore hashes **only mutation-invariant intrinsic content**, recomputed from a *fresh detection pass* on every load — **never a persisted cross-serialization byte digest** (`FPDFPage_GenerateContent` re-emits the whole stream, so raw byte digests of untouched objects legitimately change):

```swift
struct PDFObjectStableKey: Codable, Equatable, Hashable {
    var pageRefID: UUID
    /// Mutation-INVARIANT structural digest, recomputed from the LIVE model each detection pass.
    /// Paths: FNV-1a over segment topology (kinds + points NORMALIZED to the path's own origin —
    /// translation/scale/rotation via the matrix do NOT change it). Images: pixelDigest + dims.
    /// Annotations: /OrifoldSignaturePlacementID or contents. THE ONLY field in == / hashValue.
    var structuralDigest: UInt64

    // Ranked disambiguators — NOT part of == / hashValue:
    var quantizedBoundsHint: [Int] = []   // boundsPdf at detection, rounded to 1pt [x,y,w,h]
    var zOrderHint: Int = 0
    var typeHint: String = ""             // objectType.rawValue at detection
    var sourceXObjectName: String? = nil  // Form XObject placements

    static func == (l: Self, r: Self) -> Bool { l.pageRefID == r.pageRefID && l.structuralDigest == r.structuralDigest }
    func hash(into h: inout Hasher) { h.combine(pageRefID); h.combine(structuralDigest) }
}
```

**Re-identification on reopen / after every commit-reload:**
1. `objectMap(for:)` rebuilds fresh `DetectedObject`s from the (post-round-trip) bytes.
2. Each persisted `ObjectEditOperation` re-binds to its object by, in order: **(a) `markedContentId`** if present *and Phase 0 proved AddMark survives GenerateContent* → **(b) `structuralDigest`** (position-invariant, so a moved object still matches) → **(c)** nearest `quantizedBoundsHint`, then `zOrderHint`, then `typeHint` — the same nearest-bounds tie-break the text path already relies on (`:2370-2374`).
3. If neither AddMark nor structuralDigest survives the round-trip (Phase 0 disproves both), the system falls back to (c) alone — the exact behavior the text path ships with today.

This is **the make-or-break identity contract; Phase 0 must validate it before the architecture is committed** (§12, §16, Appendix A decision 3).

---

## 4. Editability Classification

> **CANONICAL enum.** Defined exactly in the `PDFTextEditability` style (`PDFTextEditingModels.swift:13-34`), assigned during detection from `objectType` + `confidence` + `clipInfo` + document permissions. Every object resolves to exactly one editability — never "editable or nothing." Ignore the alternate 5-case/7-case enums that appeared in draft sections; those are expressed here as the derived capability set (§4.1).

```swift
enum PDFObjectEditability: String, Codable {
    case directAnnotationEdit          // DIRECT_ANNOTATION_EDIT
    case directVectorEdit              // DIRECT_VECTOR_EDIT
    case directImageEdit               // DIRECT_IMAGE_EDIT
    case formWidgetEdit                // FORM_WIDGET_EDIT
    case formXObjectInstanceEdit       // FORM_XOBJECT_INSTANCE_EDIT  (ships in v1)
    case formXObjectSourceEdit         // FORM_XOBJECT_SOURCE_EDIT     (v1-DEFERRED → fallback message)
    case groupedObjectEdit             // GROUPED_OBJECT_EDIT
    case inferredArtifactEdit          // INFERRED_ARTIFACT_EDIT
    case rasterRegionReplace           // RASTER_REGION_REPLACE
    case lockedOrPermissionRestricted  // LOCKED_OR_PERMISSION_RESTRICTED
    case unsupported                   // UNSUPPORTED
}
```

### 4.1 Derived capability set (the UI / hit-test / export dispatch key off THIS, not a second enum)

```swift
struct ObjectCapabilities {
    var canMove, canResize, canRotate, canRestyle, canReplaceImage: Bool
    var canDeleteStructurally, canDuplicate, canLayer: Bool
    var isOverlayBacked: Bool     // Orifold annotation/decoration → baked, never a content-stream write
    var isReadOnly: Bool
}
extension PDFObjectEditability { var capabilities: ObjectCapabilities { /* per the table below */ } }
```

Operation vocabulary: **move, resize, rotate, delete, duplicate, align, layer (z-order), restyle (stroke/fill/width/dash/opacity), replace-image**. Every fallback message is a ready-to-author `L10n` key + English value (all six languages, via `L10n.format` with `%lld`/`%@` for interpolation).

| Editability | Allows | Blocks | Fallback message (`key` → en) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **directAnnotationEdit** — annotation-backed (ink/note/stamp/Orifold signature). Already works via `PageObjectSelectionTarget` (`:1624`) + `updateStampDecoration`/`updateSignaturePlacement` (`:3447, 3480`). Overlay-baked on export, no ghost. | move, resize, rotate, delete, duplicate, align, layer, restyle | nothing (crypto-sig invalidation guard `:3345` still applies) | — |
| **directVectorEdit** — high-confidence path/line/rect/ellipse, **no clip**. `SetMatrix`/`Transform` + style setters → `GenerateContent`+`SaveAsCopy`. **Delete = `FPDFPage_RemoveObject`+`Destroy` (structural, no leak).** | move, resize, rotate, delete, duplicate, align, layer, restyle | nothing | — |
| **directImageEdit** — high-confidence image XObject, **no soft mask**, no clip. | move, resize (aspect-lock offered), rotate, delete (structural), duplicate, align, layer, replace-image, opacity | stroke/fill/dash restyle (meaningless for raster) | `object.editability.image.styleUnsupported` → "Stroke and fill styling don't apply to images. You can move, resize, rotate, replace, or delete this picture." |
| **formWidgetEdit** — PDFKit widget (`isPDFWidget`). | move, resize, align, layer, delete-widget (confirm) | duplicate (breaks AcroForm names), rotate, restyle of field content | `object.editability.formWidget.restricted` → "This is a fillable form field. You can reposition or remove it, but its contents and duplication are managed in the form tools to avoid breaking the form." |
| **formXObjectInstanceEdit** — one placed instance of a reused `/Form` XObject. **Transforms only THIS placement's matrix** (`FPDFPageObj_Transform` on the form object — the `Do` invocation's CTM — not the shared stream). **Ships in v1.** | move, resize, rotate, delete (this instance), duplicate (new instance), align, layer | editing shared interior content (deferred) | `object.editability.formXObject.instanceOnly` → "This is a reused graphic placed in several spots. You can move, resize, or remove this copy — but its interior look-and-feel can't be changed yet." |
| **formXObjectSourceEdit** — editing the shared `/Form` stream so *every* placement updates. **v1-DEFERRED**: no safe per-page write path (`GenerateContent` is per-page; the source stream is shared). Resolves to a gated explicit action or a message. | selection + inspection | every structural mutation in v1 | `object.editability.formXObject.sourceDeferred` → "Changing this reused graphic everywhere at once isn't available yet — edit an individual copy instead." |
| **groupedObjectEdit** — inferred `tableGrid` cluster. Group op fans out to one op **per member** (§8.4), applied structurally. | move, resize (scales all), delete (group), duplicate, align, layer, restyle (all member strokes) | per-segment edits (drill into a child → `directVectorEdit`) | `object.editability.group.hint` → "Selected a group of %lld lines. Edits apply to all of them — click again to pick a single line." |
| **inferredArtifactEdit** — medium/low-confidence decorative rule/divider/tint. | move, delete (structural via `RemoveObject`), restyle, opacity, layer | — (not default-selectable; requires "select artifacts") | `object.editability.artifact.lowConfidence` → "This looks like a decorative element, but Orifold isn't fully sure it's a separate object. Edits may affect nearby graphics — check the result before saving." |
| **rasterRegionReplace** — clipped/masked/soft-masked/flattened soup, no clean object boundary. | rectangular region cover/replace (disclosed visual-only); true removal only via the gated qpdf redaction path | move, resize, rotate, duplicate, restyle, layer | `object.editability.raster.regionOnly` → "This area is part of a scanned or flattened image with no separate objects. You can cover or replace a region, but individual shapes here can't be moved or restyled." |
| **lockedOrPermissionRestricted** — `!allowsContentModification` / crypto-signed. | selection + inspection only | every mutation | `object.editability.locked` → "This document restricts edits to its content. Remove the restriction (or the signature) to edit this object." |
| **unsupported** — shading/gradient, unclassifiable-above-low. | selection + inspection only | every mutation | `object.editability.unsupported` → "Orifold can't edit this kind of object yet. It's shown for reference only." |

**Honesty requirement (rasterRegionReplace).** The cover-patch path is **visual-only and leaks the original bytes** (`PDFEditedPageRenderer.swift:71-96, 147` re-embeds the whole original stream). The UI must **never** call it "redact" or "remove"; only the gated qpdf structural path may claim removal.

**Grounding note.** Editability is computed once at detection and stored on `DetectedObject.editability`; the UI reads it to enable/disable controls, showing the fallback message via a non-blocking disclosure (reuse the one-time `NSAlert` disclosure used for the visual-only-erase warning), never a hard error. Every structural mutation MUST route through the PDFium `SetMatrix`/`RemoveObject`/`InsertObject` → `GenerateContent` → `SaveAsCopy` chain (`PDFCompressionService.swift:233, 250`) — **never** the rasterizing `PDFEditedPageRenderer.regeneratedPage`, which would repeat the erase leak and flatten the page — followed by the mandatory validation gate (§8.4). Never `PDFPage.copy()` a rendered page (`PDFKitEngine.swift:38-46`).

---

## 5. Hit-Testing & Selection Model

Resolves a click on `OrifoldPDFView` to zero/one/many editable objects. It consumes `DetectedObject` (§3); it does not parse content streams.

### 5.1 Where it hooks in
- **Click dispatch:** the single `NSClickGestureRecognizer` (`ReadingCanvas.swift:391-395`) fires `handleClick(_:)` (`:590-660`). A new `.selectObject` tool case (and the passive `.none` case, §7) calls a new `objectHitTest(at:on:in:)` beside `editableTextBlock(at:on:in:)` (`WorkspaceViewModel.swift:2359`) and `stampDecoration(at:on:in:)` (`:3421`). Reuse the existing guards verbatim: `inlineEditor?.containsInteractivePoint` bail (`:593`) and `guard let page = pdfView.page(for:nearest:), !(page is BoundaryPage)` (`:596-597`).
- **Coordinate conversion:** `pdfView.convert(viewPoint, to: page)` — already in native/unrotated page space (§5.4). No `/Rotate` correction.
- **Selection overlay:** a new `ObjectSelectionOverlayView` cloned from `SignatureSelectionOverlayView` (`:1654-1903`), registered in `makeNSView` (`:397-419`), refreshed via `refreshObjectOverlay` (sibling to `refreshSignatureOverlay`, `:1101-1115`), and **added to `gestureRecognizerShouldBegin`** (`:681-688`, which today only checks `signatureOverlay`/`inlineEditor`). Its `hitTest` returns `nil` when hidden or off its interaction frame (like `:1696-1701`).
- **Selection state:** new `@Published var objectSelection` on the view model, beside `selectedAnnotation`/`selectedStampDecorationID`, mutually exclusive with them.
- **Scale/scroll sync:** reuse the existing `.PDFViewScaleChanged` (`:469, 1034`) and clip-view `boundsDidChange` observers (`:522-542`). Do **not** add a second observer set.

### 5.2 Selection state

```swift
struct ObjectSelection: Equatable {
    var pageRefID: UUID?               // single-page; cross-page multi-select disallowed
    var objectKeys: [PDFObjectStableKey]   // ordered; .last is primary (anchor for handles/align)
    var isMarquee: Bool
    var isEmpty: Bool { objectKeys.isEmpty }
    var primary: PDFObjectStableKey? { objectKeys.last }
    var isMulti: Bool { objectKeys.count > 1 }
}
```
`@Published var objectSelection = ObjectSelection()`. Setting a non-empty selection clears `selectedAnnotation`/`selectedStampDecorationID` and dismisses any live `InlineTextEditorOverlay` (§7), preserving the single-selection-lane invariant (`:644-653`). **Selection stores `PDFObjectStableKey`, never a raw pdfium index.** After any commit-reload, the overlay **re-resolves** each key against the fresh `objectAnalysisCache` (§3.6); unresolved keys drop out silently.

### 5.3 Pipeline (returns a ranked list, so the pick and the chooser share one path)

```swift
struct ObjectHit { let object: DetectedObject; let region: HitRegion; let pointerDistance: CGFloat }
enum HitRegion: Equatable { case fill; case edge(distance: CGFloat); case handleSlop }
func objectHitTest(at viewPoint: CGPoint, on page: PDFPage, in pdfView: PDFView) -> [ObjectHit]
```
1. Reject boundary pages; resolve `pageRef(for:in:)` (`:6203`).
2. `q = pdfView.convert(viewPoint, to: page)` — native/unrotated space.
3. Scale-aware slop (§5.5) from `pdfView.scaleFactor`.
4. Per-object test (§5.5) → `HitRegion` + `pointerDistance`.
5. Filter background-like unless nothing else hit (§5.7).
6. Score + sort (§5.6).
7. `handleClick` takes `[0]`; if `[0]`/`[1]` are ambiguous (§5.8), open the chooser.

### 5.4 Page `/Rotate` — the coordinate contract (do not "un-rotate" the click)
`pdfView.convert(_:to: page)` already returns native/unrotated page space — proven by `editableTextBlock(at:)` feeding that point straight into `textAnalysisEngine.hitTest` (raw PDFium coords, no rotation math) and by `SignatureSelectionOverlayView` using plain `pdfView.convert` on rotated pages. `DetectedObject.boundsPdf` is in this same space; compare like-for-like directly. The only rotation at hit-test time is the **object's own** `transform` (§5.5.1). Page `/Rotate` is fully absorbed by PDFKit's `convert`. (One consequence for §8: the commit renderer normalizes `/Rotate` as `PDFEditedPageRenderer` does at `:19-33, :84`, and object geometry passed to it is already in this native space — no conversion at the selection→commit boundary.)

### 5.5 Per-object test (fill, edge, thin-line tolerance)

Distances are in **content-space points**; the slop is constant in **screen points** so targets feel identical at every zoom:
```swift
let kMinHitSlopScreenPts: CGFloat = 6, kEdgeGrabScreenPts: CGFloat = 4
let scale = max(pdfView.scaleFactor, 0.01)             // same guard as :3686
let slopContent = kMinHitSlopScreenPts / scale, edgeGrabContent = kEdgeGrabScreenPts / scale
```
- **Fill hit** — `pathData?.isFilled` and local point inside the path (even-odd/nonzero) → `.fill`, distance 0.
- **Thin-line / stroke hit** — min distance-to-segment over `pathData.flattenedStroke` (pre-flattened in detection); hit if `minSegDist <= max(style.lineWidth/2, 0) + slopContent + edgeGrabContent` → `.edge(distance:)`.
```swift
func distanceToSegment(_ p: CGPoint, _ a: CGPoint, _ b: CGPoint) -> CGFloat {
    let ab = CGVector(dx: b.x-a.x, dy: b.y-a.y); let len2 = ab.dx*ab.dx + ab.dy*ab.dy
    if len2 == 0 { return hypot(p.x-a.x, p.y-a.y) }
    let t = min(1, max(0, ((p.x-a.x)*ab.dx + (p.y-a.y)*ab.dy) / len2))
    return hypot(p.x-(a.x+t*ab.dx), p.y-(a.y+t*ab.dy))
}
```
- **AABB fallback** — images/shadings: inside local AABB → `.fill`; within `slopContent` of an edge → `.edge`.

**5.5.1 Transformed/rotated objects.** Inverse-transform the click into object-local space (O(1) per object):
```swift
let affine = object.transform.cgAffineTransform      // PDFTextEditingModels.swift:58-60
guard affine.determinant != 0 else { return aabbTest(q, object.boundsPdf) }   // near-singular shear guard
let local = q.applying(affine.inverted())
```
**5.5.2 Minimum target size.** Inflate the hit region (never the drawn frame) so a 2×2pt icon stays clickable, mirroring the `-18` interaction-frame inset (`:1696-1701`):
```swift
let kMinTargetScreenPts: CGFloat = 12
let padX = max(0, (kMinTargetScreenPts - object.boundsPdf.width*scale)/2)/scale   // (padY symmetric)
let inflated = object.boundsPdf.insetBy(dx: -padX, dy: -padY)
```

### 5.6 Scoring — the exact seven-rule priority (lexicographic, not weighted)

| # | Rule | Better = |
|---|------|----------|
| 1 | Active tool mode | `toolAffinity` (exact 2 / neutral 1 / mismatch 0) higher |
| 2 | Clicked-object confidence | `confidence.rank` higher |
| 3 | Distance to edge/fill | fill (dist 0) beats edge; smaller edge distance |
| 4 | Z-order / frontmost | larger `zOrder` |
| 5 | Object size | smaller AABB area (small object atop a big one is the target) |
| 6 | Text-vs-graphic | in `.selectObject`/`.none`, graphic beats text; in `.editText`, text wins (§7) |
| 7 | Decorative/background-like | non-background beats background |

Implement as a `Comparable` tuple `(toolAffinity, confidence.rank, regionRank, -edgeDist, zOrder, -area, graphicRank, nonBackground)` and `sort` descending — Swift tuple `<` gives exact lexicographic precedence, no weights to tune.

### 5.7 Never selecting the page background
Classifier tags `isBackgroundLike` for ≥92%-crop-box objects, full-bleed rects, decorative artifacts. `let ranked = foreground.isEmpty ? hits : foreground` — a background object is chosen only when nothing else was hit (and rule 7 still keeps it last). Empty canvas → `[]` → `clearSelection()`.

### 5.8 Overlap & disambiguation chooser
Open the chooser only when `[0]`/`[1]` tie down to z-order/size (same tool-affinity, confidence, region, edge distance within 0.5pt); else pick `[0]`. The chooser is a lightweight SwiftUI popover (re-inject `\.locale`, `:537-568`) anchored at the click, listing tied objects in rank order with a kind glyph + z-order badge, using the `MoreMenuRow`/`MoreIconTile` kit (`:3094-3176`); hovering a row live-previews its outline, clicking commits, `Esc`/click-outside dismisses. **Cycle-on-repeat-click fallback:** clicking the same point again (within `kMinTargetScreenPts`, 1.2s) advances to `ranked[(prev+1) % count]` without reopening the popover ("⌥-click to cycle down the stack"). Copy keys: `objectPicker.title` → "Select object", `objectPicker.badge.front/back`, `objectPicker.kind.*` ("Shape/Line/Image/Group/Form field/Text/Gradient").

### 5.9 Gestures: single, Shift-click, marquee, Escape
Selection changes are **not undoable** (only edits register undo, `:1320`).
- **Single** — `objectHitTest` → pick/chooser → `select(single:on:)`: sets `objectKeys=[key]`, clears other lanes, dismisses any text editor, mounts the overlay at `pdfView.convert(boundsPdf, from: page)`.
- **Shift-click** — toggle membership; if the hit is on a *different* `pageRefID`, **replace** (single-page invariant). Multi-select draws a union box with **move + delete only** (no group resize in v1 — base resize is axis-aligned, no aspect lock, `:1850`).
- **Marquee** — drag on empty canvas **only while `.selectObject`**. Clone `CommentRegionOverlayView` (`:1389-1438`) into `ObjectMarqueeOverlayView`. **Critical:** that overlay's `hitTest` returns `self` whenever visible (`:1471-1473`) and would steal PDFKit's text-selection drag, so keep it `isHidden = true` except when `.selectObject` is active and no object is under `mouseDown`. On `mouseUp`, convert the rect to page space (`:1428-1435`, no rotation math) and select every object whose AABB **intersects** (not merely contains) the marquee and is not `isBackgroundLike`; Shift+marquee unions. Single-page only.
- **Escape** — `OrifoldPDFView.keyDown` (`:1227-1237`), keyCode 53, with §7.4 precedence; **falls through to `super.keyDown` when idle** so Escape still reaches the responder chain.

### 5.10 Live update / undo / delete hazard (cross-refs)
Selecting never mutates bytes. A committed move/resize/delete flows through §8's commit path. Two hazards this section respects but does not solve:
- **Delete must not repeat the visual-only-erase leak** — route through PDFium `RemoveObject`+`GenerateContent`+`SaveAsCopy` (`PDFCompressionService.swift:233, 250`), never `PDFEditedPageRenderer`, never `dataRepresentation()`. Selection supplies the durable key; the delete engine resolves it to a live pdfium index **at commit time**.
- **After any commit the document reloads** (`:2698-2701`); the overlay re-resolves `objectKeys` against the fresh cache and re-lays-out handles.

## 6. UX Design

All new AppKit drawing uses `NSColor.ds*NS`; all SwiftUI chrome uses `Color.ds*`/`Font.ds*`/spacing/radius tokens. No hardcoded colors/spacing/fonts. **The UX action set keys off the §4.1 capability set** (derived from the canonical `PDFObjectEditability`), not a second enum.

### 6.1 The mode
New `AnnotationTool.selectObject` case (`WorkspaceViewModel.swift:74-158`; `isColorable=false`, `isReaderModeAllowed=false`). Renders in `AnnotationToolPicker.toolGroups` (`ContentView.swift:1655-1662`); `select(_:)` (`:1935-1966`) mounts/dismisses the object contextual surface as it does signature/stamp palettes. New service-tint pair `dsObjectAccent`/`dsObjectAccentSoft` next to `dsEditTextAccent`/`dsSignatureAccent` (`DesignSystem.swift:56-97`), branched in `toolAccent`/`toolAccentSoft` (`:1913-1933`). **The whole feature is behind a feature flag** (Appendix A, decision 8); v1's object selection requires the explicit Select-Object tool so text editing is never disturbed.

### 6.2 Selection chrome (`ObjectSelectionOverlayView`)
Sibling of `SignatureSelectionOverlayView` (`:1654-1903`): clone its 8-handle geometry, `DragMode`, `handleRects` (`:1833`), `resizedFrame` min-size clamp (`:1850`), and `pdfView.convert(proposedFrame, to: page)` commit (`:1784`). Driven by a generalized `PageObjectSelectionTarget` (`:1624-1652`) carrying a `stableKey` alongside the existing annotation/stamp cases. Mounted last in z-order (its handles win over the draw-only `PageDecorationOverlayView` whose `hitTest` returns nil, `:1475`); subscribes to `.PDFViewScaleChanged` (`:1034`) + clip-view `boundsDidChange` (`:522-542`) so handles never drift; `hitTest` returns `self` only inside the interactive frame.

Visual spec (drawn in `draw(_:)`, mirroring `:1703-1738`):
- **Outline** — 1px `dsAccentNS`. For `rasterRegionReplace`/deferred objects, a dashed `dsAccentSoftNS` stroke signals "visual-only".
- **8 handles** — 8×8pt white squares (radius 2) with `dsAccentNS` border, shown only for editabilities permitting resize (§4.1); annotation/`overlayBacked` images offer aspect-locked corners only; `rasterRegionReplace` hides all resize handles.
- **Rotation handle** — a 10×10pt `EnsoRing` (`:369-387`) 20pt above top-center on a `dsSeparatorNS` stem, shown only when `capabilities.canRotate` (image/vector). Hidden for widgets/annotations/raster in v1.
- **Delete button** — 16×16pt circle + white X, `NSColor.systemRed` (the one semantic non-`ds` color, for destructive clarity). For `rasterRegionReplace` it dims and invokes the disclosed "Cover (visual only)…" flow.
- **Cursors** — body: `openHand`→`closedHand` on drag; handles: the per-handle `ResizeHandle` cursors (`:1884-1899`); rotation: a rotate cursor (fallback `crosshair`). Refreshed in `resetCursorRects()` on scale/scroll.

### 6.3 Object-type tooltip
On hover (via `NSTrackingArea`), a one-line tooltip at the outline's top-left names the type + editability — e.g. "Vector shape · editable", "Reused group · this copy only", "Table border · visual-only" — via `object.tooltip.format` = "%@ · %@". This is the primary way users learn *why* an object may be non-editable, replacing a wall of disabled controls. Styling: `Color.dsCard`, `dsRadiusSm`, `Font.dsCaption`, `dsElevation()`; re-inject `\.locale` if hosted.

### 6.4 Contextual object toolbar
A floating AppKit toolbar, sibling to `InlineTextEditorOverlay` (`:2351`), mounted like `showInlineTextEditor` (`:767`), positioned above the selection (flipping below near the top edge, using the clip-view-aware positioning at `:2730-2748` and subscribing to `boundsDidChangeNotification`). Primary controls inline; everything else in a **"More" overflow** reusing `ToolbarMoreMenu` + `MoreRoute` + `pendingMoreRoute` (`:2968-3176, 2932-2946`) — never a popover-out-of-a-popover-button (`:618-623`). All buttons reuse `ToolbarIconButton`/`ToolbarIconMetrics`/`ToolbarVerticalDivider`; presentation logic factored into its own `ViewModifier` (like `ToolbarOverflowPresentations`, `:2878`), never inlined into `ContentView.body`.

Inline controls (each shown only when §4.1 enables it; disabled ones render inactive **with an explanatory tooltip, never hidden**): **Duplicate** · **Delete** · ｜ · **Stroke color** · **Fill color** · **Opacity** · ｜ · **Layer** (forward/back) · **More** (line width, dash, align, distribute, replace image, reset, numeric fields). For images, stroke/fill collapse into **Replace image…**. For `rasterRegionReplace`, structural controls disable and Delete → "Cover (visual only)…".

**Optional numeric fields** — a "More" toggle reveals X/Y/W/H (PDF points) + a rotation-degrees field when supported; commit on Return/blur through the `constrainedSignatureBounds` cropBox clamp (`:3515`), producing one `OBJECT_TRANSFORM` op per commit. Values shown after applying the page-`/Rotate` inverse so the user sees on-screen coordinates.

### 6.5 Direct-manipulation UX requirements
- **No-jump drag (grab-offset).** On `mouseDown`, `grabOffset = mouseDownPagePoint − object.originPage`; during drag, `newOrigin = currentPagePoint − grabOffset`. (The current signature overlay lacks this offset term.)
- **No flicker (preview proxy above the cached bitmap).** The heavy `regenerate + rebuild` is **never** run per drag frame. The overlay draws a **preview proxy** — a `CGImage` snapshot of the object's region captured on `mouseDown` (via a `drawPageForSampling`-style off-screen raster, clipped to bounds), or the object's `CGPath` for vectors — and only `setNeedsDisplay` during the drag (the signature-drag technique, `:1770-1804`). Because content-stream objects are not PDFKit-drawn, the proxy is mandatory. To hide the still-visible original under the moving proxy, paint a `sampledBackgroundColor` patch (`PDFEditedPageRenderer.swift:404-458`) over the original bounds **for the preview only** — discarded on `mouseUp` (the committed bytes come from the structural write-back, never the patch).
- **Accurate cursor tracking at all zooms** — all conversion via `pdfView.convert` (incorporates `scaleFactor`); handle sizes from `max(pdfView.scaleFactor, 0.01)` (`:3685`).
- **Subtle snapping/guides** — snap to page edges, page center (H+V), and other objects' edges/centers (from `objectAnalysisCache`) within a 4pt view-space threshold; draw a 1px `dsAccentSoftNS` guide; **hold ⌥ to disable**. Guides drawn, never committed.
- **Rotated pages (highest-risk path).** v1 default: **if the Phase-2 coordinate test does not validate rotated-page write-back, `objectHit` returns non-editable on `pageRotation != 0`** and the overlay shows `object.error.rotatedPageUnsupported` (mirroring the existing rotation bail-outs at `WorkspaceDocument.swift:356, 369`). If it validates, convert view→page→raw-content-space via the inverse of `getDrawingTransform(.mediaBox, rotate:)` (`PDFEditedPageRenderer.swift:32-45, 81-96`) before writing the matrix. **Ship whichever the test validates; do not ship untested rotated-page transforms.** (Appendix A, decision 7.)
- **Crypto-signature guard** — every edit routes through `markAnnotationsModified(warnAboutSignatureInvalidation:)` (`:3345, 3468, 3503`).

### 6.6 New i18n keys
All keys in `Localizable.xcstrings` with en+es+fr+hi+zh-Hans+ja (or `LocalizationCoverageTests` fails, `:57-78`), via `L10n.string`/`L10n.format` passing `@Environment(\.locale)`; interpolation uses `%@`/`%lld`; new popovers re-inject `\.locale`.
- **Tool:** `annotationTool.selectObject.label` → "Select"; `.helpText` → "Select and edit objects on the page".
- **Types/editability:** `object.type.{vectorShape,image,path,formXObject,tableBorder,annotationObject,formWidget,group,shading}`; `object.editability.{editable,visualOnly,imageReplaceable,instanceOnly}`; `object.tooltip.format` → "%@ · %@".
- **Actions:** `object.action.{duplicate,duplicateAsOverlay,delete,coverVisualOnly,copy,paste,bringForward,sendBackward,alignLeft,alignCenter,alignRight,alignTop,alignMiddle,alignBottom,distributeH,distributeV,replaceImage,strokeColor,fillColor,opacity,lineWidth,dashStyle,resetTransform,rotate,showNumericFields}`.
- **Undo names:** `object.undo.{move,resize,rotate,delete,duplicate,replaceImage,style,reorder}`.
- **Numeric fields:** `object.field.{x,y,width,height,rotation}`.
- **Errors/disclosures:** `object.disabled.fallbackOnly`, `object.disabled.needsImage`, `object.cover.visualOnlyWarning` → "This only hides the object visually — the original data stays in the file. Use Redact for true removal.", `object.error.commitFailed`, `object.error.exportVerifyFailed`, `object.error.rotatedPageUnsupported`.

### 6.7 New keyboard shortcuts
Each added in **two** places (drift hazard, `ShortcutRegistry.swift:42-46`): `ShortcutRegistry.all` under `.editing` **and** a real binding. Delete reuses `onDeleteKey` (`:1227-1237`). Nudge/⌘D/copy/paste/layer/Esc are handled in a dedicated overlay `keyDown` (mirror `:4169-4205`); the overlay is `firstResponder` while a selection exists. Global-menu equivalents (Duplicate, Bring/Send) in `AppCommands.body` (`:18-59`).

| Action | Keys | Registry key |
|---|---|---|
| Nudge / Nudge×10 | arrows / ⇧+arrows | `shortcut.object.nudge` / `shortcut.object.nudgeLarge` |
| Duplicate / Delete | ⌘D / ⌫⌦ | `shortcut.object.duplicate` / `shortcut.object.delete` |
| Copy / Paste | ⌘C / ⌘V | `shortcut.object.copy` / `shortcut.object.paste` |
| Bring Forward / Send Backward | ⌥⌘] / ⌥⌘[ | `shortcut.object.bringForward` / `shortcut.object.sendBackward` |
| Cancel transform | Esc | `shortcut.object.cancel` |

---

## 7. Text vs Object Mode Interaction

### 7.1 Interaction modes (computed, not persisted)
```swift
enum CanvasInteractionMode: Equatable { case idle, textCaret, objectSelected, objectDragging, marquee, toolPlacement }
```
Invariant: **entering `textCaret` clears `objectSelection`; entering an object mode dismisses any live text editor** via the editor's existing `finishForHandoff()`/`Completion` teardown (`:614, 2370-2374`) — no new commit path. One lane is live at a time (extension of `:644-653`).

### 7.2 Arbitration decision table
Evaluated in `handleClick` after both `objectHitTest` (§5) and `editableTextBlock(at:)` run. "Text hit" = a real text region (not bare `.insertion` on empty space); "Object hit" = ≥1 non-background object.

| Active tool | Text? | Object? | Overlap? | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `.editText` | yes | any | — | **Edit text.** Object lane suppressed. |
| `.editText` | no | yes | — | No-op (objects not selectable while Text tool active; mode stays explicit). |
| `.editText` | no | no | — | Existing text behavior (caret/insertion, `:614-621`). |
| `.selectObject` | any | yes | — | **Select object.** Text lane suppressed. |
| `.selectObject` | yes | no | — | Select the text run *as an object* if classified selectable (rank rule 6); else no-op. Does **not** open the text editor. |
| `.selectObject` | no | no | — | `clearSelection()`. |
| `.none` | yes | no | — | Existing `.none` = annotation-only today; passive text-open here is a **new, flag-gated extension** (off until objects ship). |
| `.none` | no | yes | — | Select object (single). |
| `.none` | yes | yes | **yes** | Disambiguate by z-order + glyph-ink vs fill: fill of a frontmost graphic → object; glyph ink → text; tie → chooser listing both. |
| `.none` | yes | yes | no | Pick smaller `pointerDistance` (rule 3). |

With an explicit tool, **the tool is authoritative** (rule 1) — no cross-lane surprises. Only passive `.none` auto-arbitrates, and even then glyph-ink-vs-fill decides, falling back to the chooser rather than guessing. (Correction vs. an earlier draft: `.none` today does **not** open the inline text editor — that is `.editText`'s job; the passive text-open row is a new flag-gated behavior, not current behavior.)

### 7.3 Drag, double-click, toolbar
- **Dragging a selected object never starts text editing:** the overlay's `hitTest` returns `self` (`:1696-1701`) and it is in the `gestureRecognizerShouldBegin` guard (`:681-688`), so the drag enters `objectDragging`, never `textCaret`, even over a text run.
- **Double-click:** add a second `NSClickGestureRecognizer` (`numberOfClicksRequired = 2`) and `singleClick.require(toFail: doubleClick)`. Double-click **text** → enter text edit (`showInlineTextEditor`, `:767`), regardless of tool (the sanctioned crossover). Double-click **object** → object-specific edit (shape → inline stroke/fill/width; image → replace; `formXObject` instance → select-within *this instance's* children, editing which affects **only this instance** — see §4/§10, and the corrected Form-XObject semantics in Appendix A decision 2). Double-click empty → no-op.
- **Toolbar swaps with mode** (reusing the capsule + `select(_:)`, `:1935-1966`): `textCaret` → text-format controls; `objectSelected`/`objectDragging` → object controls (align/distribute/forward-back/duplicate/delete/stroke/fill/width) in a sibling contextual bar + `More` + a new object-properties Inspector tab (extend `InspectorView.Tab`, `:9-27`, **with its own localized keys** — the existing tab picker uses `Tab.rawValue` and is not localized). Text controls hide in object mode and vice versa.

### 7.4 Escape precedence (first match wins; one keypress peels one layer)
1. Chooser open → close, keep selection.
2. `objectDragging`/`marquee` in flight → cancel, revert to pre-drag bounds (no commit, no undo).
3. `textCaret` → editor handles its own Esc (commit/cancel, `:2370-2374`); then → `idle`.
4. `objectSelected` → `clearSelection()`; → `idle`.
5. `idle` → `super.keyDown` so Esc propagates (popover dismiss, reader-mode exit) — **do not swallow it** (unlike Delete, which always consumes).

---

## 8. Object Edit Lifecycle & Operation Model

> **CANONICAL operation model.** Follows inline-text conventions but the byte-level write-back runs through the **PDFium structural chain** (`GenerateContent`+`SaveAsCopy`, `PDFCompressionService.swift:201-256`), never `PDFEditedPageRenderer`. Ignore the alternate op names (`PDFObjectEditOperation`) from draft sections; the canonical op is `ObjectEditOperation`.

### 8.1 `ObjectEditOperation`
Added to `Orifold/Models/PDFObjectEditingModels.swift`, hand-written `init(from:)` with `decodeIfPresent` (mirroring `:247-283`).
```swift
enum ObjectEditType: String, Codable { case objectTransform, objectDelete, objectReplace, objectStyleChange, objectReorder }
enum ObjectReplacementStrategy: String, Codable {
    case pdfiumStructural   // SetMatrix/Transform/Set*Color/Width + RemoveObject/InsertObjectAtIndex + GenerateContent + SaveAsCopy (leak-free)
    case overlayComposite   // Orifold overlay (signature/stamp) baked on export; never a content-stream write
    case coverPatch         // visual-only cover (rasterRegionReplace ONLY; disclosed; DOES leak bytes)
    case qpdfRedact         // gated explicit "true removal" for content PDFium can't round-trip (fallback)
}
enum ObjectCommitState: String, Codable { case preview, committed, reverted }
struct ObjectStylePayload: Codable, Equatable {   // absent key = unchanged; CodableColor reused
    var strokeColor: CodableColor?; var fillColor: CodableColor?; var opacity: CGFloat?
    var lineWidth: CGFloat?; var dashArray: [CGFloat]?; var dashPhase: CGFloat?
}
struct ObjectEditOperation: Codable, Identifiable, Equatable {
    let id: UUID
    var type: ObjectEditType
    let documentID: UUID            // MemberDocument.id
    let pageRefID: UUID             // PageRef.id — durable join key
    var sourceObjectKey: PDFObjectStableKey   // §3.6, canonical durable identity
    var markedContentId: Int?       // FPDFPageObj_AddMark hint (Phase-0-gated, §8.5)
    var objectType: PDFObjectType
    var editability: PDFObjectEditability
    // geometry — RAW, UNROTATED content-stream space
    var originalBoundsPdf: CGRect; var newBoundsPdf: CGRect
    var originalTransform: PDFTextTransform; var newTransform: PDFTextTransform
    let pageRotation: Int
    // style
    var originalStylePayload: ObjectStylePayload?; var newStylePayload: ObjectStylePayload?
    // z-order (PDFium object-index order); realized by RemoveObject + InsertObjectAtIndex
    var originalZIndex: Int; var newZIndex: Int
    var replacementStrategy: ObjectReplacementStrategy
    var replacementImageData: Data?   // objectReplace only; keep to the RESAMPLED image (payload note §8.2)
    var committedState: ObjectCommitState
    let createdAt: Date; var updatedAt: Date
}
```

### 8.2 `PageObjectEditState`, persistence
```swift
struct PageObjectEditState: Codable, Identifiable, Equatable { let pageRefID: UUID; var operations: [ObjectEditOperation]; var id: UUID { pageRefID } }
```
Add `Workspace.objectEditStates: [PageObjectEditState] = []` next to `pageEditStates` (`Workspace.swift:140`), with a `CodingKeys` entry (`:143-145`), a `decodeIfPresent` line (`:164`), and a single `schemaVersion` bump (`:141`). `@Published workspace` wires mutations into autosave; the whole `Workspace` round-trips via `embedMetadata`/`metadata` (`:594-640, 560-587`). **Payload note:** `replacementImageData` and `editableMemberPDFData` are base64'd into a single page-0 annotation (`:612-635`), no chunking — keep `replacementImageData` to the resampled image and rely on the committed structural bytes in `memberPDFData` as the source of truth.

### 8.3 The lifecycle
1. **Select** — `objectHit(at:on:in:)` (new; modeled on `editableTextBlock`, `:2359`) via §2's enumerator, using `pageRef(for:in:)`/`memberPDF(for:)`/`localIndex(ref:memberIndex:)` (`:6203, 6237, 6245`) and `objectAnalysisCache` (§3.5). A click inside an existing op's bounds **reopens** it (re-route, `:2370-2399`). If `pageRotation != 0` and rotated-page write-back isn't validated (§6.5), return a non-editable `rotatedPageUnsupported` result.
2. **Preview (temporary)** — the overlay drags a **proxy** only (§6.5); a reopened op is mutated in a scratch copy (`committedState = .preview`). No write to `objectEditStates`, no regenerate, no undo, no autosave. Bytes untouched.
3. **Commit** (mouse-up / Done / field-Return), via a new `applyObjectEdit(_:)` modeled on `applyInlineTextEdit` (`:2545-2659`):
   1. Capture the shared snapshot (§8.4) **before** mutation.
   2. Build the op from the preview delta; clamp `newBoundsPdf` via `constrainedSignatureBounds` (`:3515`).
   3. **Upsert** into `objectEditStates` keyed by `sourceObjectKey` (mirroring the `sourceBlockID` upsert, `:2606-2635`): preserve the *original* baseline fields and `markedContentId` from the first op so successive drags **coalesce into one op** (solves the op-per-drag-tick gap).
   4. `committedState = .committed`, `updatedAt = now`.
   5. `regenerateObjectEditedPage(pageRef:operations:)` (step 4 below).
   6. `rebuild()` + `markWorkspaceModified()`.
   7. `registerIsolatedUndo` (`:1320-1331`) with localized `setActionName` (`object.undo.*`).
   8. On regenerate/validation failure, roll back to the snapshot **including member bytes** (fixing the text path's partial rollback at `:2641`): restore `objectEditStates`, `document.memberPDFData`, `loadedPDFs`, then `rebuild()`; surface `object.error.commitFailed`.
4. **Live update via structural write-back** — `regenerateObjectEditedPage` parallels `regenerateEditedPage` (`:2681-2709`) but replaces the `PDFEditedPageRenderer` call with a PDFium mutate pass in a **new engine `PDFObjectEditEngine`** (alias-`@_silgen_name`, holds `pdfiumLock` across load→mutate→save):
   - Starts from pristine `originalMemberPDFData`; applies **all committed ops for that member** to the in-memory PDFium doc; produces new member bytes via `SaveAsCopy`.
   - `objectTransform` → `SetMatrix`/`Transform` mapping `originalBoundsPdf`→`newBoundsPdf` in raw space.
   - `objectStyleChange` → `SetFillColor`/`SetStrokeColor`/`SetStrokeWidth`/`SetDashArray` from `newStylePayload`.
   - `objectReplace` → `LoadJpegFileInline`/`SetBitmap` (as compression, `:302`).
   - `objectReorder` → `RemoveObject` then `InsertObjectAtIndex(newZIndex)`.
   - `objectDelete` (structural) → `RemoveObject` + `Destroy` — **true removal, no leak.**
   - `objectDelete` on `rasterRegionReplace` → `coverPatch` only, behind the disclosed `object.cover.visualOnlyWarning`, via `drawErasePatch`/`sampledBackgroundColor` (`:147-155, 404-458`). **The sole intentionally-leaky path; the UI says so.**
   - `overlayComposite` ops (signatures/stamps) → **no content-stream write** at edit time; handled by existing overlay draw + export bakers. `regenerateObjectEditedPage` skips them.
   - Then `GenerateContent(page)` + `SaveAsCopy` → new member `Data`. **Object resolution is by `markedContentId` (if Phase-0-proven) or `sourceObjectKey` recomputation over the freshly-loaded objects (§8.5), never a stored index.**
   - **Mandatory validation gate** (before accepting bytes): reopen the produced `Data`; assert (a) page count unchanged; (b) per-page text unchanged for pages carrying text — using **`PDFTextAnalysisEngine`/`attributedString`, never `PDFPage.string`** (CI quirk, memory `ci-xcode164-pdfkit-string-extraction-quirk`); (c) the ghost/duplicate object-count guard (§8.5). On failure → step 3.8 rollback.
   - Write validated bytes into `document.memberPDFData` and reload a fresh `PDFDocument` (mirroring `:2698-2707`); clear `objectAnalysisCache` for the affected pages. **Do NOT route the PDFium output through `PDFSerializer`/`dataRepresentation` for the member bytes** — store the `SaveAsCopy` bytes directly (PDFKit still *loads* them for display, which is lossless; only PDFKit *re-serialization* is destructive).
5. **Undo/redo** — §8.4; restores geometry/style/z-order **and bytes**; integrates with ⌘Z/⌘Y automatically.
6. **Persist** — `objectEditStates` rides `@Published workspace` → autosave → embedded metadata. Extend `sourcePayloadsForPDFMetadata` to bail when it is non-empty (`:340`). **Revision 2 (§0.1.3/4):** extend the pristine-base persist-condition (`OrifoldMetadata.editableOriginalMemberPDFData`) to fire for members with object ops, and make `reconcileCommittedEditsWithLoadedPages()` (`:2946`) regenerate `f(pristine, textOps ∪ objectOps)` — a text-only self-heal on an object-edited page would otherwise silently revert every object edit. Sanitized shares strip this metadata by design (§0.1.6): edits stay baked, re-editability is lost.
7. **Export** — the H1-at-assembly landmine (§9). Committed structural ops are already leak-free in `memberPDFData`, but `concatenateForExport` (`PDFKitEngine.swift:83-104`) and comment/metadata stages re-serialize via `dataRepresentation()` and would re-destroy the layer. Mitigation: a **qpdf-preserving export assembly** (`PDFExportNormalizer`, §9) that splices edited member bytes unchanged and concatenates with qpdf; overlay bakes use the CGContext-direct path (`SignatureAppearanceRenderer.swift:309-355`) via a new `applyObjectExportAdditions` stage; `.preview` ops are skipped.
8. **Reopen-from-bytes verification** — after `writePDFExportData` writes atomically (`:4498-4534`), reopen the just-written file **from disk**, re-run the §2 enumerator on affected pages, and assert (per §9): each transform/style object present at `newBoundsPdf`/style within tolerance; each structural `objectDelete` object **absent** (`coverPatch` deletes are exempt — instead assert the patch is present); and the per-page object-count equals the expected post-edit count (ghost/duplicate guard). Failure aborts export → `object.error.exportVerifyFailed`.

### 8.4 Snapshot undo/redo (extend the shared snapshot; also handles multi-select batches)
Rename `InlineTextEditSnapshot` → `EditStateSnapshot` and add `objectEditStates`:
```swift
struct EditStateSnapshot {
    let editStates: [PageEditState]              // text
    let objectEditStates: [PageObjectEditState]  // NEW
    let pageRotations: [UUID: Int]
    let pdfData: [UUID: Data]                     // member bytes — the leak-free SaveAsCopy bytes
}
```
- **Capture** before commit; **Restore** sets both op arrays, rebuilds `loadedPDFs`/`memberPDFData` from `pdfData`, `objectAnalysisCache.removeAll()` + `textAnalysisCache.removeAll()`, `rebuild()`. Because restore reinstates the `SaveAsCopy` bytes, undo/redo is **byte-exact** (no `GenerateContent` re-run).
- **Batch/multi-select commit:** N object ops on one page are applied to the PDFium doc, then a **single** `GenerateContent`+`SaveAsCopy` runs for that page, under **one** `registerIsolatedUndo` group. Never one save per object (`applyObjectEdit` accepts an op array). Align/distribute and group edits fan out to N `objectTransform` ops committed this way.

**Align/distribute geometry** (multi-select): the anchor is the selection's **union bounding box**. Align L/C/R and T/M/B snap each object's edge/center to that union rect's edge/center; distribute H/V equalizes gaps between sorted object centers. Each produces one `objectTransform` matrixDelta; all batched.

**Copy/paste** serializes the object's reconstructable payload (kind, segments/bitmap, style, bounds) into an in-memory `ObjectClipboardItem`; paste **creates a new object** (`CreateNewPath`/`NewImageObj` + `InsertObjectAtIndex`) with a fresh `stableKey` — additive, no ghost. Cross-page paste clamps to the target cropBox (`constrainedSignatureBounds`, `:3515`); pasting an `overlayComposite`/annotation object appends the overlay model instead.

### 8.5 Durable identity (`sourceObjectKey`, with an AddMark optimization)
See §3.6 for `PDFObjectStableKey`. Two layers, **re-resolved from a fresh detection pass every load** (never trust a persisted cross-serialization byte digest):
1. **Optimization: marked-content id.** On the first structural write-back, stamp `FPDFPageObj_AddMark` and persist `markedContentId`; on later loads, re-select by scanning marks — exact. **Gated on Phase 0 proving marks survive `GenerateContent`+`SaveAsCopy`+reload** (unverified today; Phase 0 must add this assertion). If unproven, this layer is disabled and identity relies entirely on layer 2.
2. **Canonical: structural digest + disambiguators.** `structuralDigest` over rotation/translation/scale-invariant intrinsic content, recomputed from the live model each pass, matched then tie-broken by `quantizedBoundsHint` → `zOrderHint` → `typeHint` → `sourceXObjectName`. Because the digest excludes post-edit geometry, an op re-binds to the same physical object after index renumbering *and* after its geometry changed.
- For visually-identical overlapping twins (same digest), disambiguate by `markedContentId` if present, else by nearest `quantizedBoundsHint`; **pre-write, treat a digest collision as "user must re-select," never silently editing the wrong twin.**

## 9. Export & Serialization Strategy

The highest-risk section. Two audited hazards dominate:
- **H1 — PDFKit re-serialization destroys the text/vector layer.** Every export stage funnels through `PDFSerializer.data` → `dataRepresentation()` (`PDFSerializer.swift:10-23`), dropping Type3/Skia. Import protects via qpdf (`PDFImportNormalizer.swift:38-73`) but there is **no export-side equivalent** — and even a leak-free `SaveAsCopy` member is **re-serialized again** by `concatenateForExport` (`PDFKitEngine.swift:83-104`) and by comment/metadata re-serialization (`WorkspaceDocument.swift:445, 636`). "Lane A produced clean bytes" is necessary but **not sufficient**; the *assembly* must be hardened.
- **H2 — erase is visual-only / content leaks.** `PDFEditedPageRenderer.regeneratedPage` replays the *entire* original stream then paints an opaque patch over it (`:14-96, 147-155`). A vector move reusing this leaves a **ghost** + a **duplicate**. The single most important thing the object system must not repeat.

**Three lanes, chosen per object by editability:**
- **Lane A — PDFium structural rewrite** (`SetMatrix`/`Transform` + `RemoveObject` + `GenerateContent` + `SaveAsCopy`). The only leak-free, ghost-free path for native in-content objects; reuses the proven chain (`PDFCompressionService.swift:201-256`).
- **Lane B — overlay bake** for objects never in the original bytes (Orifold signatures/stamps/new shapes) — *additive*, no ghost. Modeled on `SignatureExportBakingSupport.bake` returning CGContext bytes directly (`:309-355`). (Its page redraw is still H1-exposed → route through the export normalizer on Type3/Skia pages.)
- **Lane C — cover-and-redraw fallback**, the *honest* last resort for shading/clipped/flattened. Explicitly a visual cover, never claimed as removal. True byte removal on a Lane-C delete is available only via the gated qpdf redaction action.

**Strategy → editability → engine (decision matrix):**

| Object type | Editability | Move/Resize/Rotate | Restyle | Delete | Duplicate | Engine |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Image XObject | directImageEdit | `SetMatrix` | replace bitmap | `RemoveObject`+`Destroy` | `NewImageObj`+copy stream | PDFium (A) |
| Vector path/line/arrow/rect/ellipse/table border | directVectorEdit | `SetMatrix` | `SetStroke`/`Fill`/`Width`/`Dash` | `RemoveObject`+`Destroy` | `CreateNewPath`+replay segments | PDFium (A) |
| Form XObject instance | formXObjectInstanceEdit | placement matrix (this instance only) | n/a (source shared) | `RemoveObject` (this placement) | new `Do` on same source | PDFium (A), instance-only |
| Form XObject source (all copies) | formXObjectSourceEdit | **v1-deferred** | — | — | — | (gated qpdf, deferred) |
| PDFKit annotation/widget | directAnnotationEdit/formWidgetEdit | `annotation.bounds` | annotation props | remove annotation | copy annotation | PDFKit (B) |
| Orifold signature/stamp/new shape | directAnnotationEdit (overlay) | placement rect | swatch/style | drop model | append model copy | baker (B) |
| Shading (type 4) | unsupported/rasterRegionReplace | cover-redraw | n/a | cover → gated qpdf redact | n/a | CGContext + qpdf (C) |
| Clipped/masked soup | rasterRegionReplace | cover-redraw | limited | cover → gated qpdf redact | n/a | (C) |
| Flattened/scanned raster | rasterRegionReplace → directImageEdit | `SetMatrix` if single image; else region | replace bitmap | region | n/a | PDFium if image, else (C) |
| Locked/encrypted | lockedOrPermissionRestricted | blocked | blocked | blocked | blocked | none |

**Ghost avoidance — the critical rule.** Moving a vector/image object **mutates that one object's matrix in place**; `GenerateContent` re-emits the page from PDFium's model so the original op is *replaced*, not supplemented. One object before and after. **No cover patch. No `drawPageBackground` replay** for structural edits. Delete = `RemoveObject`+`Destroy` — the honest object-delete the audit says has "no existing path." (**Corrected:** delivery-draft's claim that a Form-XObject-instance transform changes *both* instances is wrong — each `Do` invocation is a distinct page object with its own CTM, so `FPDFPageObj_Transform` on it moves only that placement; changing all copies requires the deferred shared-source edit. See Appendix A decision 2.)

**Duplicate (PDFium has no clone API).** Create a new object of the same type and copy properties: image → `NewImageObj` + re-set bitmap + offset matrix + `InsertObject`; path → `CreateNewPath` + replay segments + copy style + offset + insert; annotation/overlay → append the model copy (`placeStamp`/`placeSignature`, `:3386, 3314`); Form XObject instance → a new `Do` on the same source name. Additive, fresh `stableKey`, no ghost.

**The export-side qpdf normalizer (H1 mitigation, mandatory).** New `PDFExportNormalizer.normalizedData(...)` in `Orifold/Engine/`, hooked before `writePDFExportData` (`:4536`), operating on the **final assembled document**:
1. Prefer a **qpdf-preserving assembly**: instead of `concatenateForExport`'s PDFKit re-serialize, concatenate the raw Lane-A `SaveAsCopy` member bytes with qpdf (structural merge, no `dataRepresentation()`), mirroring import's approach (`PDFImportNormalizer:38-73`), gated on `isTrustworthy` page-count agreement (`:79-91`).
2. For pages that went through a Lane-B/C bake, run a `QPDFService.sanitized`-style re-linearize (`:98-117`) on the assembled bytes — no `dataRepresentation()`.
3. Never `PDFPage.copy()` Lane-A/CGContext pages (`PDFKitEngine.swift:38-46`).
4. If qpdf assembly isn't viable (page-count disagreement, malformed member), fall back to `concatenateForExport` **and record the export is H1-exposed** so the reopen check catches a dropped text layer rather than shipping it silently.

> **This qpdf-preserving assembly is substantial new C-interop and is arguably the single hardest piece of the feature** (not a small splice). It is a first-class Phase 3 deliverable (Appendix A decision 5).

**Post-commit validation gate (mandatory).** `GenerateContent` rebuilds the whole stream and can perturb untouched operators; add `PDFObjectEditValidator`, modeled on `PDFEncryptionService.validateEncryptedData` (`:43-72`): page count unchanged; per-page text preserved on non-edited pages (via `PDFTextAnalysisEngine`/`attributedString`, **never `PDFPage.string`** — CI quirk); edited object present at `newBoundsPdf` (re-detect); **ghost canary — detection-based, not byte-digest** (re-enumerate objects intersecting `originalBoundsPdf`; assert none matching the moved object's `(type, structuralDigest)` remains — byte digests false-positive because `GenerateContent` legitimately reorders operators). On failure, roll back including member bytes.

**Reopen-fidelity verification (new — none exists today).** After `writePDFExportData`, reopen the written file **from disk bytes**, re-run detection on each edited page, assert every committed op's object present at `newBoundsPdf` (± tolerance) and no matching object at `originalBoundsPdf`; re-run the non-edited-page text canary against the pre-export snapshot to catch an H1 assembly drop. Byte-level, not in-memory. (`coverPatch` deletes are scoped out of the "no leak" assertion — see acceptance §13.)

**Export requirements checklist** (all must pass on exported-and-reopened file): no duplicate · no ghost (Lane A guarantees; Lane C is disclosed visual-cover) · object at new position · reopen shows edits from bytes · non-edited content unchanged (text canary; no raw byte-digest equality) · no orphaned streams · rotation/coords correct (verified on 90/180/270) · z-order preserved (`InsertObjectAtIndex`) · renders across Orifold/Preview/Chrome/Acrobat (qpdf structural check + manual QA spot-check for the first release, since cross-viewer `GenerateContent` fidelity is the untested risk) · crypto-safe (no silent signature break).

**Recommended primary engine:** **PDFium structural rewrite (Lane A), with qpdf reserved for assembly preservation + gated true redaction.** Justification: the mutate→`GenerateContent`→`SaveAsCopy` chain is already shipping/proven in Orifold (`PDFCompressionService`); it is the only lane offering per-object matrix/style mutation (the exact primitive that avoids ghosts by construction); `SaveAsCopy` sidesteps H1 at the member level. qpdf is co-primary only for assembly (concatenate raw member bytes structurally) and the gated "Flatten & redact region" action (`qpdf_oh_get_page_content_data`/`replace_stream_data`, `qpdf-c.h:930, 946`, wrapped in `withQPDF` recovery). qpdf is **not** the primary edit engine — a matrix-move via qpdf means hand-editing operator spans (fragile under its C++ exception model). Accepted trade-off: `GenerateContent` may perturb operator fidelity in pathological files → mitigated by the mandatory validation gate + reopen check.

## 10. Edge Cases

For each: detection / selection / edit / export / exact message. All copy in `Localizable.xcstrings` (6 languages; `%lld`/`%@` for interpolation); new popovers re-inject `\.locale`.

- **Scanned / image-only** — single full-page `IMAGE` → `directImageEdit` (whole page); path-soup → `rasterRegionReplace`. Whole-page image moves/replaces; overlays on top are fully editable. `objectEdit.scanned.wholePageOnly` → "This looks like a scanned page. You can move or replace the whole image, but individual marks inside a scan can't be edited separately."
- **Locked / permission-restricted** — reuse import smoke-check (`PDFiumProcessingEngine.validatePDF:31-76`) + PDFKit `allowsContentModification`; if not permitted, all objects `lockedOrPermissionRestricted`. **Hard block by policy** (PDFium's `SaveAsCopy` wouldn't itself enforce DRM — this is an explicit Orifold policy gate). `objectEdit.locked.blocked` → "This PDF's permissions don't allow editing its contents. Remove protection first (Tools ▸ Security) to edit objects." Deep-link the decrypt flow if the user holds the owner password.
- **Malformed** — `LoadMemDocument`/`GenerateContent`/`SaveAsCopy` errors or two-parser disagreement (`isTrustworthy:79-91`). Attempt qpdf repair (`withQPDF` recovery, `:147-148`); if it fails, block. Never write a member that fails the validation gate. `objectEdit.malformed.repairPrompt` → "This page couldn't be parsed cleanly. Orifold can try to repair it before editing." / on failure `objectEdit.malformed.blocked`.
- **Clipped** — `GetClipPath` → `hasClip`. Select by visible bounds, transform the full object matrix. Move preserves the clip; resize revealing hidden content is allowed but warned. `objectEdit.clipped.mayReveal` → "This object is clipped. Resizing it may reveal parts that were hidden."
- **Masked images** — image with `/SMask`/stencil (via `GetImageMetadata`, **new decl**). Move/resize keeps the mask; **replacement blocked** unless the replacement carries a compatible mask → `rasterRegionReplace` for replace. `objectEdit.masked.replaceUnsupported` → "This image has a transparency mask. Moving it works, but replacing it isn't supported yet."
- **Invisible artifacts** — `Tr 3` invisible text (`:113`), transparent fill, `/Artifact`. Hidden from normal selection; surfaced via an inspector "Show hidden objects" toggle (mirror the hidden/low-visibility text classification). On opt-in, delete uses real `RemoveObject` (leak-free — invisible OCR text is exactly the export-leak vector). `objectEdit.invisible.hiddenNotice`.
- **Very thin lines** — stroke width < ~0.75pt or 0. Inflate the hit rect (§5.5.2; mirror `stampDecoration` inset `-4`); preserve zero-width on restyle (don't coerce 0→1). No message.
- **Overlapping shapes** — top-most-first by z-order (`stampDecoration(at:).reversed()`); ⌥-click/repeat-click cycles; inspector lists all hits. `zOrderIndex` preserved on commit (`InsertObjectAtIndex`). `objectEdit.overlap.cycleHint` → "Multiple objects here. Click again or ⌥-click to select the one underneath."
- **Table borders** — many short `directVectorEdit` paths, each cell border usually its own op. Individual selection; marquee multi-select for group move; batch = N ops → **single** `GenerateContent`/`SaveAsCopy` per page under one undo group. `objectEdit.tableBorder.singleSegment` → "You're moving one border line. Select the whole table to move the grid together."
- **Repeated Form XObjects (instance vs source)** — multiple `FORM` objects referencing the same `sourceXObjectName`. Selects one placement (`formXObjectInstanceEdit`). **The default (and only auto) edit transforms this placement's matrix, changing only this instance.** Editing the shared source (`formXObjectSourceEdit`, v1-deferred) is never implicit — it is a gated explicit action with a count confirm. `objectEdit.formXObject.instanceNotice` → "This graphic is reused %lld times on this page. Your edit affects only this copy."
- **Grouped objects** — Form XObject bundling children (heuristic) or Orifold group (out-of-scope, must not break). Select the placement as a unit; double-click enters *this instance's* children (`directVectorEdit`/`directImageEdit` via `FPDFFormObj_GetObject`/`RemoveObject`). `objectEdit.group.enterHint` → "Double-click to edit objects inside this group."
- **Very large images** — move/resize is a matrix op (cheap, no re-decode); **do not rasterize on drag** (overlay proxy). Replacement decodes **off the `pdfiumLock` critical path** on a background queue. Matrix-only `SaveAsCopy` doesn't re-encode pixels. `objectEdit.image.tooLarge`.
- **High-DPI** — geometry is resolution-independent; handles subscribe to the same `.PDFViewScaleChanged` + clip-view `boundsDidChange` as the inline editor (`:1034, 522-542`). No message.
- **Rotated pages** — `PageRef.rotation` captured; convert on commit via the renderer's rotation-neutralization (`:32-45, 81-96`) — the double-rotation landmine the `pageRotation`-vs-`rotation` split prevents. `SetMatrix` operates in unrotated space, so un-rotate the drag delta before it becomes a matrix. Validation gate **re-runs specifically on 90/270**. v1 punt if not validated (§6.5). `objectEdit.rotated.unsupported`.
- **Multi-page** — `pageRef(for:in:)` skips `BoundaryPage` banners; guard `!(page is BoundaryPage)`. Ops per-page in `PageObjectEditState`. No message.
- **Undo/redo across pages** — `EditStateSnapshot` restores `objectEditStates` + affected member bytes + rotations for **all** touched members, so undoing on page 5 while viewing page 12 is safe; `syncDocumentPreservingViewport` handles the viewport. No message (menu shows the localized action name).
- **Copy/paste across pages** — additive new object at the target (§8.4); default same content-space offset, clamped to target cropBox. `objectEdit.paste.reposition` → "Pasted to fit this page." (only when clamped).
- **Objects outside page bounds** — clamp `newBoundsPdf` to the cropBox (`constrainedSignatureBounds:3515`); partial off-page allowed, fully-off-page prevented. `objectEdit.bounds.clamped` → "Kept the object on the page."
- **Deleting shared/reused objects** — delete removes **this placement's page object** (`RemoveObject`), not the shared source; `GenerateContent` drops the orphaned source only if this was the last reference. `objectEdit.shared.deleteInstance` → "Deleted this copy. %lld other copies remain." **Never** silently delete all instances.
- **Background watermarks** — distinguish Orifold-authored (`PageDecoration.kind == .watermark`) from native (large low-opacity object, often `/Artifact`). Orifold watermark → overlay, clean delete via `replaceDecorations` (`:2218`). Native detectable object → Lane A `RemoveObject` (leak-free). Native flattened → `rasterRegionReplace` cover → gated qpdf redact. `objectEdit.watermark.coverOnly` → "This watermark is part of the page content. Orifold can cover it, but to remove it from the file, use Flatten & redact." (no warning for the clean Orifold case).

## 11. Testing Matrix

All tests under `Tests/OrifoldTests/`, following existing conventions: fixtures built **in code** (there is no fixtures directory), an `NSView`/PDFKit page rendered via `view.dataWithPDF(inside:)` and reopened with `PDFDocument(data:)` (mirror `UserFlowRegressionTests.swift:12-28`, `QPDFServiceTests.swift:214-217`), assertions on `attributedString?.string` and `darkPixelCount` (`InlineEditExportHardeningTests.swift:105, 142-143`), PDFium/qpdf round-trips serialized under `pdfiumLock`. **A fixture that must contain a known-typed vector path or image XObject cannot come from `dataWithPDF` alone** — build it with the PDFium creation API (`CreateNewPath`/`NewImageObj` + `InsertObject` + `GenerateContent` + `SaveAsCopy`) so detection asserts on a deterministic object graph. **Revision 2 (§0.1.7): `ObjectFixtureFactory` extends the shipped `Tests/OrifoldTests/Support/EditingFixturePDFBuilder.swift`** (its CGContext strokes already surface as genuine PATH page objects) rather than starting fresh. New files: `ObjectDetectionTests`, `ObjectEditCommitTests`, `ObjectEditExportReopenTests`, `ObjectFixtureFactory` (helper), plus `LocalizationCoverageTests` additions. Add four Revision-2 rows to the matrix: (36) delete a rule serving as a text underline → text block re-analyzes without `underline=true` (§0.1.2); (37) text op + object op on one page → forced divergence → reconcile → both survive (§0.1.4); (38) `duplicatePages` clones object ops; cross-member `movePage` rebases pristine (§0.1.5); (39) sanitize an object-edited export → edits visible, `objectEditStates`/pristine absent (§0.1.6, mirror `SanitizedExportLeakTests`).

**Legend:** **RP** = reopen-from-bytes; **PDFium** = object round-trip; **qpdf** = content-stream path; **px** = pixel assertion; **model** = pure Swift/undo assertion.

**Rows 11, 12, 20, 34 are the highest-value guards** (structural delete proven from reopened bytes; text layer survives the rebuild). They must assert **from reopened bytes**. Row 26 is the Form-XObject correctness guard — **it asserts only the clicked instance moves** (correcting the earlier wrong "both change" fixture).

---

## 12. Verification Loops

Each loop is build → run → observe → fix, exited only when every criterion passes. End each with `swift build && swift test`; `LocalizationCoverageTests` green before a loop counts complete.

**Loop 0 (gate) — Phase-0 spike (see §16 Phase 0).** Prove on real fixtures that PDFium `GenerateContent`+`SaveAsCopy` round-trips move/delete/transform **without perturbing untouched text/vectors**, that identity survives (AddMark and/or structuralDigest), and that a co-located text run still extracts after commit. **If this fails, the structural architecture is revised before Loop 1** (narrow to annotations+images + disclosed cover-redraw). This gate is non-negotiable.

**Loop 1 — Architecture + basic selection (no export).** Model + detection for the three reliable types (annotation, image XObject, simple vector path); selection handles; move + delete; undo/redo; live in-canvas update. No export, Form XObjects, rotation, or styling. **Exit:** (1) clicking an image, a signature, and a stroked rect each shows the 8-handle overlay; blank click clears; (2) object hit-test doesn't break text editing (Test #32) and the overlay is in `gestureRecognizerShouldBegin` with correct `hitTest`; (3) move+delete commit as ops; canvas live-updates with no viewport jump; mid-drag preview is the overlay proxy, heavy regenerate only on mouseUp; (4) ⌘Z restores geometry AND bytes, ⌘Y re-applies, undo-of-delete restores the object (Tests #17, #18); (5) detection cached per pageRef off the `pdfiumLock` hot path, first-click budget met on a 100-page fixture (Test #31); (6) `swift build && swift test` green, no new `pdfiumLock` deadlock under `ImportStressTests`.

**Loop 2 — Export + reopen reliability (hazard-critical).** Committed edits survive save → close → fresh reopen **from file bytes**. Build the `applyObjectExportAdditions` stage + PDFium `SaveAsCopy` bake (never `PDFSerializer`), the `PDFExportNormalizer` qpdf-preserving assembly, the post-commit/post-export validation gate, structural delete (PDFium primary; qpdf fallback), and the `objectEditStates` round-trip. **Exit:** (1) move/resize/delete/duplicate/restyle → Export → fresh reopen asserts each edit from bytes (Tests #19–21); (2) **no ghost** — deleted object absent + region background (Tests #11, 12, 20); (3) **no duplicate** — exactly one instance at the new location; (4) exported file passes the qpdf structural check + a real text run survives to reopened `attributedString?.string` (Test #34); (5) reopening restores `objectEditStates` for continued editing; (6) encryption path still passes (`validateEncryptedData:43-72`); (7) large-fixture export stays under (or consciously outside) the decoration size guards (`:29-30`).

**Loop 3 — Edge-case hardening + UX polish.** Fallback classification + copy (Form XObjects, repeated instances, table soup, shading, clipped/masked, scanned); rotated-page correctness; overlap disambiguation + cycle; resize/duplicate/style/z-order; nudge coalescing; snapping/guides; toolbar/inspector; align/distribute; multi-select batch commit. **Exit:** (1) every fallback type classified with specific localized copy, no destructive control it can't honor (Tests #25–28); (2) move/resize/delete pixel-correct on `/Rotate 90/270` from reopened bytes (Tests #22, 23) — or the documented v1 punt is in place; (3) overlapping objects individually selectable + reorderable, z-order persists across reopen (Tests #4, 16); (4) handles track through zoom+scroll (Test #24); (5) malformed/locked degrade gracefully, zero crashes (Tests #29, 30); (6) `LocalizationCoverageTests` green, `swift build && swift test` green, SwiftLint clean.

## 13. Acceptance Criteria

Done when every box is checked, each backed by a §11 test:
- [ ] **Select common objects** — lines, rectangles, ellipses, images, logos, signatures/stamps, form widgets, annotation objects, with visible handles (Tests #1–6).
- [ ] **Core operations on supported objects** — move, resize, delete, duplicate on the reliably-editable types; stroke/fill/opacity + bring-forward/send-backward on vector/image (Tests #7–16).
- [ ] **Object mode never breaks text editing** — a click on a text run still opens the inline text editor (in the default tool, unchanged behavior); object hit-testing ordered so `.editText` reaches `editableTextBlock(at::2359)` (Test #32).
- [ ] **Unsupported objects classified and explained** — scanned/flattened, shading, clipped/masked, repeated Form XObject instances detected and labeled with localized *why*, never a silent no-op; repeated-instance edits explain that only this copy changes (Tests #25–28).
- [ ] **Live update** — every committed edit updates the page in place, no viewport jump (Tests #7, 17).
- [ ] **Undo/redo** — every op a single undoable step; undo-of-delete restores the object; undo restores member **bytes**; batched nudges collapse into one op (Tests #8, 17, 18).
- [ ] **Save/export preserves edits and the text layer** — exported bytes contain the edits; a real text run survives the `GenerateContent` rebuild (Test #34); encryption/permissions still pass (Tests #19–21, #34).
- [ ] **Fresh reopen shows edits from bytes** — close+reopen shows every edit from file bytes, not app memory (Tests #19–23).
- [ ] **No ghost, no duplicate** — a deleted **structural** object is gone from the page-object graph with no leaked ink; a moved object exists exactly once at its new location (Tests #11, 12, 20). *(Scope: `rasterRegionReplace` cover-deletes are disclosed visual-only — they satisfy "no visual ghost" but the underlying bytes remain by design, surfaced to the user; they are not held to structural absence.)*
- [ ] **Large PDFs stay responsive** — detection/selection/commit on a 500-page/~50MB doc never stalls the main thread; detection cached per pageRef, off `pdfiumLock`'s hot path (Test #31).
- [ ] **Crypto signatures respected** — object edits on a signed document warn/invalidate consistently; no silent break.
- [ ] **Local-first / free / OSS preserved** — no network, no telemetry, no new paid dependency; all via bundled PDFKit/PDFium/qpdf; grep audit shows no new `URLSession`/analytics; license check clean.

## 14. Deliverable

This document remains the binding architecture record for the implemented beta and its deferred scope. It covers architecture findings (§1), object model/data structures (§3), editability classification (§4), hit-testing (§5), UX (§6–§7), lifecycle + export (§8–§9), edge cases (§10), testing matrix (§11), verification loops (§12), acceptance (§13), risks (§15), phased steps (§16), and prioritization (§17). The canonical reconciliation decisions in **Appendix A** still govern future work so later phases extend one object system rather than introducing parallel ones.

## 15. Risks & Mitigations

| # | Risk | L | I | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R0 | **`GenerateContent` whole-stream rebuild is the load-bearing, least-validated assumption** — it can alter untouched objects/marked-content/inline images and is the mechanism identity must survive | Med | Critical | **Phase 0 gates the whole structural architecture** (§16). If the spike shows fidelity/identity loss on real fixtures, Strategies 2/3/5 and the "PDFium primary" recommendation are revised before Loop 1 (fall back to annotations+images + disclosed cover-redraw). Do not commit the architecture before the spike passes. |
| R1 | **Ghost / erase-leak on delete** | High | Critical | Route delete through PDFium `RemoveObject`+`Destroy`+`GenerateContent`+`SaveAsCopy` (rebuilds the stream with the object physically absent); never `PDFEditedPageRenderer` for object ops; gate on reopened count-decrement + region-blank (Tests #11, 12, 20). The single most important mitigation. |
| R2 | **Re-serialization destroys the text/vector layer** — `dataRepresentation()` drops Type3/Skia at member commit AND export assembly | High | High | Member bytes via `SaveAsCopy`, never `PDFSerializer`; **the `PDFExportNormalizer` qpdf-preserving assembly** (§9) handles H1 at export; post-commit text-preservation gate; Test #34. |
| R3 | **Export-assembly qpdf-preserving merge is substantial new C-interop** and is under-weighted if treated as a splice | Med | High | First-class Phase 3 deliverable (Appendix A decision 5); gate on `isTrustworthy` page-count agreement; fall back to `concatenateForExport` **and flag H1-exposed** so the reopen check catches a drop. |
| R4 | **Cross-serialization identity** — every persisted op re-binds after a reload that renumbers indices; AddMark durability is unverified | Med | High | Canonical `structuralDigest` recomputed from a fresh detection pass (never a persisted byte digest) + bounds/z/type tie-break; AddMark is a Phase-0-gated optimization with its own survival assertion; ultimate fallback = nearest-bounds (the text precedent). Proven in Phase 0, not assumed. |
| R5 | **Performance on large PDFs / commit holds `pdfiumLock`** — per-click re-parse or a big mutate+save+revalidate under the process-wide lock stalls the UI | Med | High | Detection cached per pageRef off the lock's hot path; drag preview is the overlay proxy; heavy regenerate only on mouseUp; **commit runs off the main actor with a progress indicator, preview stays until it resolves** (Appendix A decision 6); Test #31 budget. |
| R6 | **Hit-test ambiguity / gesture fighting** | Med | Med | Topmost-by-z pick, distance-to-segment tolerance, ⌥-cycle; preserve ordering so text wins where appropriate (Test #32); add the overlay to `gestureRecognizerShouldBegin` and get `hitTest` right. |
| R7 | **Rotation double-transform** on 90/180/270 pages | Med | High | Express geometry in unrotated content-stream space; reuse the renderer's normalize→re-tag; **v1 punts (disable transform on rotated pages with a message) unless the Loop-3 test validates it** (Appendix A decision 7); Tests #22, 23. |
| R8 | **Undo/redo correctness** — op-per-keystroke; failed regenerate leaves half-applied bytes | Med | Med | Coalesce deltas by `sourceObjectKey` (upsert `:2606-2635`); `registerIsolatedUndo` per commit; snapshot includes member `pdfData` and restore reinstates bytes (Tests #8, 17, 18). |
| R9 | **Crypto-signature invalidation** | Low | High | Thread `markAnnotationsModified(warnAboutSignatureInvalidation:)` (`:3345`); disable/warn object edits when a crypto signature is present (as `:405` already skips). |
| R10 | **PDFium API limits** — Form-XObject grouping heuristic; shading/clipped have no rich accessors | Med | Med | Classify fallback-only up front and restrict operations; ship "detected, explained, not editable." |
| R11 | **Scope creep** — all types × all ops at once destabilizes the reliable core | High | Med | Enforce the §17 do-first slice as a hard gate; reject any Loop-1/2 PR that adds a fallback type's write path. |

## 16. Phased Implementation Steps

Each phase is independently shippable (behind the `objectEditingEnabled` feature flag until Phase 5) and independently testable.

**✅ Phase 0 — SHIPPED (2026-07-09, `Phase0PDFiumRoundTripSpikeTests`, 2 tests green). GATE PASSED — see §0.2 for results + the mandatory color-preservation mitigation.**

**Phase 0 — Spike: PDFium + qpdf round-trip proof (throwaway harness, 1–2 days; the architecture gate).** No production code merged. Load a fixture, enumerate objects, translate one image via `SetMatrix`, `GenerateContent`, `SaveAsCopy`, reopen the **bytes**; assert the image moved, count unchanged, and a co-located text run still extracts. Delete one object via `RemoveObject`+`GenerateContent`; assert count decremented + region blank. **Also assert AddMark survives `GenerateContent`+`SaveAsCopy`+reload**, and that `structuralDigest` (normalized geometry) re-matches after the round-trip. Spike qpdf `qpdf_oh_get_page_content_data`/`replace_stream_data` for one delete to confirm the fallback. Follows the native-build-verification approach (standalone harness, full call chain). **Purpose: de-risk R0/R1/R2/R4 before any UI. If it fails, revise the architecture here.**

**✅ Phase 1 — SHIPPED (2026-07-09).** `Orifold/Models/PDFObjectEditingModels.swift` (all canonical types + `PDFObjectEditability`/`ObjectCapabilities` + `ObjectEditOperation`/`PageObjectEditState`), `Orifold/Engine/PDFiumObjectBindings.swift` (`poe_*` `@_silgen_name` surface + the mandatory `poeTouchPathColorsForGenerateContent` mitigation), `Orifold/Engine/PDFObjectDetectionEngine.swift` (per-page enumeration + line/rect/ellipse/shape/image/form/shading classification + editability + `structuralDigest`), `Workspace.objectEditStates` + schemaVersion 5→6. Tests: `ObjectDetectionTests` (7 green: line/rect/image detection, determinism, permission-lock, malformed-graceful, capability map, Codable round-trip + legacy decode). Full suite 659 green. **Deferred to later phases:** PDFKit annotation/widget detection pass, Tier-B table clustering (§2.2), bezier-accurate flatten + image pixelDigest, unifying the scan with `graphicsIndex(page:)` (§0.1.1).

**Phase 1 — Object model + detection (no UI).** Canonical types (`PDFObjectEditingModels.swift`): `PDFObjectEditability` (§4), `ObjectEditOperation`/`PageObjectEditState` (§8), `DetectedObject`/`PageObjectMap`/`PDFObjectStableKey` (§3); `Workspace.objectEditStates` + CodingKeys + `decodeIfPresent` + schemaVersion bump. New `PDFObjectDetectionEngine` (type-agnostic enumerator, alias-`@_silgen_name`) with per-pageRef caching and the stable-identity scheme — **built by generalizing `PDFTextAnalysisEngine.graphicsIndex(page:)`'s existing walk (§0.1.1), keeping `PageGraphicsIndex` as a derived view so text analysis is untouched.** Classifies the three reliable types + all fallback types. **Tests:** `ObjectDetectionTests` (#1–6, #25–28 classification) + `PageGraphicsIndexTests` stays green. Ships: detection API + model, zero UI.

**Phase 2 — Selection + move/delete + undo (live, no export).** Generalize `PageObjectSelectionTarget`; mount `ObjectSelectionOverlayView`; `objectHit(at:)`; `applyObjectEdit` → `regenerateObjectEditedPage` (PDFium path); snapshot extension carrying `objectEditStates` **and** `pdfData`; delete-key wiring; flag-gated `.selectObject` tool; overlay in `gestureRecognizerShouldBegin`. **Tests:** `ObjectEditCommitTests` (#7, #11 in-memory, #17, #18, #32). **Exit = Loop 1.** Ships: in-app move/delete/undo, live.

**Phase 3 — Export + true delete + reopen fidelity.** `applyObjectExportAdditions` in `exportedPDFDataThrowing:274`; PDFium `SaveAsCopy` bake (no `PDFSerializer`); **`PDFExportNormalizer` qpdf-preserving assembly**; post-commit/post-export validation gate; qpdf content-stream fallback delete; `objectEditStates` round-trip; extend `sourcePayloadsForPDFMetadata:340`; reopen-from-bytes assertion. **Tests:** `ObjectEditExportReopenTests` (#11, 12, 19, 20, 33, 34). **Exit = Loop 2.** Ships: edits that survive save/reopen with no ghost/duplicate — the first genuinely useful release.

**Phase 4 — Resize + duplicate + styling + z-order + multi-select batch.** Resize → `SetMatrix` scale-about-anchor (Shift aspect-lock); duplicate; stroke/fill/opacity via setters; bring/send via `RemoveObject`+`InsertObjectAtIndex`; nudge coalescing; multi-select batch commit + align/distribute; styling in inspector/`MoreRoute`. **Tests:** #8, 9, 10, 13–16. Ships: full transform+style toolkit on reliable objects.

**Phase 5 — Edge-case hardening + UX polish + un-flag.** Rotated-page correctness (or the documented punt); overlap disambiguation + snapping/guides; fallback explanations (incl. repeated-instance + Form-XObject); malformed/locked degradation; toolbar service tint + all `L10n`/xcstrings 6-language entries; overlay z-order finalized; **remove the feature flag**. **Tests:** #22–24, 26–31, 35; `LocalizationCoverageTests`. **Exit = Loop 3.** Ships: GA object editing.

---

## 17. Prioritization (Do First / Do Later)

**DO FIRST — Minimum Viable Slice (Phases 0–3):**
- **Types:** (1) image XObjects, (2) existing PDFAnnotations (signatures/stamps — already have a working selection lane), (3) simple stroked/filled vector paths (lines, rectangles, ellipses).
- **Operations:** select, move, delete, undo/redo — **plus** the non-negotiable export → fresh-reopen-from-bytes guarantee with **no ghost, no duplicate**.
- **Rotation:** unrotated pages only.

**Rationale:** these three types are the only ones the audit rates *reliable* (`FPDFImageObj_*`, `FPDFPath_*`, `FPDFAnnot_*` all linked). Annotations already ride the proven `PageObjectSelectionTarget`/`SignatureSelectionOverlayView` handle system, so selection is near-free. Move + delete are the first operations users reach for. Shipping export + reopen fidelity **early** forces R1/R2/R3 to be solved in the core rather than bolted on — a delete that leaks or an export that ghosts is worse than no delete at all. The slice is small enough to reach pixel-verified reopen correctness with high confidence.

**DO LATER (Phases 4–5+):**
- **Resize, duplicate, styling, z-order** — high value; layer onto the proven move/delete spine.
- **Form XObject instance transform** — ships in v1 as `formXObjectInstanceEdit` *only after* Phase 0 confirms per-placement matrix edits round-trip; **shared-source editing (`formXObjectSourceEdit`) is deferred** (classify + explain first).
- **Rotated-page editing** — correctness-critical, smaller segment; do-first on unrotated pages, harden in Loop 3.
- **Shading/gradients, clipped/masked, scanned/flattened** — fallback-only, likely permanently. Ship as "detected, explained, not editable."
- **Multi-select, grouping, align/distribute, rotation handles, snapping** — UX richness, low fidelity risk, large surface. Defer.

**Guiding rule:** ship *depth on the reliable three* (move/delete → export/reopen → resize/duplicate/style) before *breadth across object types*. Breadth without byte-level reopen fidelity ships the exact leak-and-ghost failures R1/R2 warn against.

---

## Appendix A — Canonical Reconciliation Decisions (read before writing model code)

The design workstreams independently invented incompatible versions of the same models. These are the binding decisions; do not re-introduce the alternatives.

1. **Object identity → one type: `PDFObjectStableKey` (§3.6).** Equality is `pageRefID + structuralDigest` only; `structuralDigest` is over **mutation-invariant intrinsic content** (path segment topology normalized to local origin; decoded-image pixel digest), **recomputed from a fresh detection pass every load — never a persisted cross-serialization byte digest**. `quantizedBoundsHint`/`zOrderHint`/`typeHint`/`sourceXObjectName` are ranked disambiguators, not equality terms. This reconciles the detection workstream's content-hash, the hit-test workstream's opaque token, and the export workstream's "re-hash from the live model, never across serialization" mandate — they are the same scheme stated once. `markedContentId` (AddMark) is an **optional in-session optimization, gated on Phase 0 proving it survives `GenerateContent`+`SaveAsCopy`**; identity never *depends* on it. Ultimate fallback if neither survives: nearest-bounds (the shipping text-edit behavior).

2. **Form XObject instance semantics — corrected.** `FPDFPageObj_Transform`/`SetMatrix` on a `FORM` page object mutates **only that placement's CTM** (each `Do` invocation is a distinct page object). Moving one instance moves **only** that instance. `formXObjectInstanceEdit` therefore **ships in v1** (move/resize/rotate/delete/duplicate the placement). Editing the shared `/Form` source so **all** copies change is `formXObjectSourceEdit`, **v1-deferred** (gated explicit action). **This overrides** (a) the UX draft's "Form-XObject instances are fallbackOnly," and (b) the delivery draft's Test #26/R7 claim that "the default edit rewrites the shared stream so BOTH instances change." Test #26 asserts **only the clicked instance moves**.

3. **Delete engine primacy.** PDFium `FPDFPage_RemoveObject`+`FPDFPageObj_Destroy`+`GenerateContent`+`SaveAsCopy` is the **primary, leak-free** delete (rebuilds the stream with the object physically absent). qpdf content-stream editing is a **fallback only** for pages PDFium won't round-trip. `coverPatch` is for `rasterRegionReplace` **only**, disclosed as visual-only. **This overrides** any framing of qpdf as the "true delete" and PDFium as insufficient.

4. **Editability → one enum: `PDFObjectEditability` (§4)**, 11 cases matching the user's spec (incl. `formXObjectSourceEdit`, v1-deferred). The 5-case (UX) and 7-case (export) variants become the **derived `ObjectCapabilities`** set (§4.1) that UI/hit-test/export dispatch key off — not competing enums.

5. **One op struct: `ObjectEditOperation` (§8.1)** with `PageObjectEditState`, `Workspace.objectEditStates`, and a **single coordinated `schemaVersion` bump**. One detected-object struct: `DetectedObject` (§3.3). One cache: `objectAnalysisCache: [UUID: PageObjectMap]`. Confidence: the **reused** `PDFTextEditConfidence` + `.rank` (never a new confidence enum).

6. **Export-assembly H1 is a first-class, hard deliverable.** The `PDFExportNormalizer` qpdf-preserving assembly (§9) is substantial new C-interop, scheduled in Phase 3, not treated as a splice. Even leak-free member bytes are re-destroyed by `concatenateForExport` without it.

7. **Concurrency for commit.** Detection runs off the `pdfiumLock` hot path (cached). **Commit** holds `pdfiumLock` across load→mutate→`GenerateContent`→`SaveAsCopy`→validate; for large docs it runs **off the main actor with a progress indicator**, and the drag preview proxy stays visible until the commit resolves.

8. **Rotated pages: v1 default is the explicit punt.** Object editing on `/Rotate != 0` pages is **detect+select only, transform disabled with a disclosure**, matching the existing rotation bail-outs (`WorkspaceDocument.swift:356, 369`) — **unless** the Loop-3 coordinate test validates rotated-page write-back, in which case it ships. The plan owns this decision rather than leaving it to an unwritten test.

9. **Feature flag & text safety.** The whole feature is behind `objectEditingEnabled`. v1 object selection requires the explicit `.selectObject` tool; the passive `.none`→object/text arbitration extension is flag-gated and off until objects ship. This is why acceptance criterion "a click on a text run still opens the text editor" holds — the **default** tool's behavior is unchanged.

10. **Validation canary is CI-safe.** Text-preservation checks use `PDFTextAnalysisEngine`/`attributedString`, **never `PDFPage.string`** (memory `ci-xcode164-pdfkit-string-extraction-quirk`). The ghost canary is **detection-based** (re-enumerate at `originalBoundsPdf`), never raw byte-digest equality (`GenerateContent` legitimately reorders operators).
