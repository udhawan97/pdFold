/// Brand/companion fold animation: a sheet of paper folds through three deliberate
/// creases — a diagonal valley fold, a half fold, a petal fold — then blossoms into a
/// detailed origami figure that stays **alive**. The **figure** is pluggable
/// (`PaperFigure`): the app's brand mark blooms into a crane (tsuru) and hands off to
/// the real app icon, while the dashboard companion blooms into the user's chosen
/// **dog** or **cat**, settles, and then keeps breathing and moving — the dog wags its
/// tail, the cat twitches its ears.
///
/// The whole run is driven by a single continuous clock (`TimelineView`), so the fold
/// can be **replayed on demand** (a tap, or every time a feature fires) and the settled
/// figure can animate forever without re-instantiating anything. The opening folds,
/// tile, paper shading, grain, contact shadow, and crease bevel are shared across every
/// figure; each figure supplies its own facet/crease geometry, a paper **palette**
/// (warm kraft for the dog, cool slate for the cat, warm ivory for the crane), and an
/// optional **idle wag** (which body group sways, around which pivot, how far, how fast).
///
/// Everything is vector-drawn in a `Canvas`. The three opening folds are physically
/// simulated (each flap reflects across its crease and rides a sine "lift" shadow). The
/// figure then emerges as a staggered per-part reveal — each facet unfolding from its
/// nearest point on the folded packet's actual outline — and is richly rendered like
/// real folded washi: two-tone facets shaded against a cool light, ambient occlusion
/// pooling in the fold valleys, crisp ridge highlights, tiny dark eye/nose facets, a
/// deterministic paper-fiber grain clipped to the silhouette, a contact shadow, and a
/// faint moon disc behind it (a quiet Japanese note).
///
/// For the brand crane the hand-off to the finished logo is sequenced, not crossfaded;
/// the dog/cat companions skip the hand-off and settle on the finished animal, then idle.
/// The crane stops ticking once it resolves (it has no idle wag), so the wordmark costs
/// nothing at rest; the companions keep a lightweight ~30fps idle. With Reduce Motion the
/// animation is skipped entirely and the finished figure is shown immediately.
