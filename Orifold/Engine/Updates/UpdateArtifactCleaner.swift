/// - It operates on two explicitly-passed directories and refuses any whose last path
///   component isn't in `UpdateStorePaths.cleanerOwnedDirectoryNames` — so it can never be
///   aimed at `Recovery/` (the user's pre-update work), the Application Support root,
///   `recents.json`, or the home folder.
/// - It only ever deletes **direct children** of those directories; it never recurses
///   upward and never removes the directory itself.
/// - As defence in depth it refuses to delete anything that looks like user content
///   (`.pdf`) or the recents store even if it somehow appeared inside a cache directory.
///
/// The `Recovery/` directory is deliberately out of scope: those snapshots are the user's
/// work and are only ever removed by an explicit discard, never by cleanup.
