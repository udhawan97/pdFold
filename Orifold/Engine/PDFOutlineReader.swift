/// number, so when a page moves the destination follows the object and re-resolves to
/// the new index for free; when a page is deleted its destination is left pointing at a
/// page the document no longer contains, which surfaces as `NSNotFound`. That is why
/// this type keeps no state and the workspace persists nothing: PDFKit already
/// maintains the invariant a cached index would have to hand-maintain.
///
/// Deliberately never touches `PageRef.sourcePageIndex` — that value is renormalized to
/// a member's current local layout after every structural op, so it describes today's
/// ordering rather than the imported bytes.

    /// this cap a chain of blank-labelled or dead-destination nodes is walked all the way
    /// down: measured at ~0.9s for a 10,000-level chain, against ~0.2ms with the cap.

    /// SwiftUI `body` pass, so that cost lands on the main thread on *every* render — a

    /// and this makes that guarantee ours rather than borrowed from undocumented
    /// framework behaviour.

    /// counts what was emitted, and an unresolvable node emits nothing.
